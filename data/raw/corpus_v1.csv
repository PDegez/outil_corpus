76561197990951542,3430,1716740,Starfield,"77hrs in: ""finished"" starfield.

Now, it has a NG+ mode which is intriguing, so I'm actually still playing it ... but the story actively encourages you to finish it multiple times .. and restart over and over and over, which is ... curious. So I'm onboard.

I'm still on the fence about the title as a whole.

Enjoying it? Yes, very much.

But it's hard to compare to previous titles (such as Fallout4) because I ended up playing those in a heavily modded state, which skews my memory of the raw, unmodded game.

Starfield is currently raw and unmodded. It is an RPG. It's a story. It's not about exploration, space flight, or space trucking. It's an adventure. It has a story and you are a participant.

The Bethesda feel is here in spades, and that includes a clunky interface with awful/useless filters and options (gadamn Bethesda, will you grow up and modernize this already? jesus)

There are some bugs. Even after a year of testing, I have encountered a couple of showstoppers. There are some annoying quirks I am surprised did not get addressed in the 1 year of polish they went through.

I think Bethesda has also backed themselves into a corner with their Creation Engine 2. It's essentially the same architecture as CE #1, with all the same limitations. The concept of 'cells' for building transitions, or area transitions is ... old. So to completely rebuild their engine, but to do so in a way that has a old, outdated architecture was a weird decision that I think will box them in for the decade to come. All of their future games may be ""better"", but they will all ""feel old"".

Move into a building? loading screen.
move out? loading screen.
board ship? loading screen.
Take off form the planet? loading screen.
Fly to another system? loading screen.
Fly to another planet? loading screen
Land? loading screen.
Enter the mining facility? loading screen.
Room inside the facility? loading screen.

It ends up feeling very much like a series of interconnected 'cells' where you get to do things before you transition to the next cell.

And in a world where games have demonstrated the ability to transition more smoothly - even invisibly - I question why Bethesda has hung their hat on such an archaic way of doing things.

It makes their largest game yet feel ""small"". 

Blasting across the universe across multiple planetary systems is ... a loading screen. And I'm not talking about the ability to fast travel and skip everything, but simply going from A->B is ... a loading screen. Every time. 

There is no planetary exploration and anyone who says otherwise is misguided. Planets are procedurally generated. You land in a cell. That cell has boundaries. That cell will be populated with a very limited set of re-used POIs (One day I got the same POI 3 times).

The novelty of the first exploration morphs into routine as you realize that basically you have landed in a medium sized procedurally generated terrain cell with half a dozen random things throw in it for you to walk to and explore. It feels like a sandbox a dev might make up as a proof of concept. 

Want to move a little further 'east' to explore more? take off (loading) click a new area, land (loading) and you get a new cell with a sprinkle of POIs in it. Enjoy.

And far, far, far too much of the 'quest structure' are fetch quests, and I will fight anyone who disagrees with me on that. Faaaaaaaaaaaaaaar too many fetch-style quests. Heck, the main effing story is a fetch quest. Exploring a planet is a fetch quest, where you don't know where anything is and you might spend 2 hrs trying to figure out where that last ""1 fauna of 9"" is located ... while effing walking everywhere. Te - di - ous.

I have always felt that Bethesda creates great experiences, and even better foundations for modders to go nuts with, and it's the modded experience that really makes it for me.

Here Starfield absolutely and firmly falls into that camp. It is a great foundation for what is to come.
Don't get me wrong, I have been enjoying the experience and I will continue to do so, but I am looking forward to mods buffing out the Bethesda quirks and menu annoyances, and hopefully some reason to build an outpost (because right now there isn't one).

Currently ... I think I will give this a 6.5 or 7 out of 10. Tops.",2023-09-11 23:48:12,146138594,1,True,False
76561198019226251,7783,1716740,Starfield,"[h1]Space is the backdrop, not the playground[/h1]
With a title like that, you're probably expecting me to say Starfield was disappointing. This could not be further from my true feelings about the game.

To put it bluntly, Starfield's space travel is inferior to No Man's Sky or Elite:Dangerous. If you are looking for a game where you can live in your ship and chill with your crew as you drift towards your next destination, Starfield will not fulfill your dreams. Space is simply used as the backdrop for something much bigger than Bethesda has ever done before. That's not to say space travel isn't important. It is very important! But most of the time, space is used as a means of getting from one planet to another via fast travel/warping.

[b]Space is just a loading screen... or is it?[/b]
You might ask ""Does anything happen in space, since it's just a loading screen?"" The answer is actually yes! Very often! During warps, the game will run a check of your route to see if you would run into any random events. If so, you will be sent out of the loading screen and back into space. You can interact with the random event, or simply begin fast travel again. In my opinion, this simply cuts out all the slow moments of space travel and highlights the fun parts. Although, there is a catch. To trigger the route check, you will have to already be in space. Make sure to take off in your ship whenever you want to fast travel. In the case you forget to do so, random events can still happen but only at the destination of your warp.

The vastness of space and the insane number and variety of planets are the main attraction of Starfield. If you are familiar with Bethesda games, walking and talking is a large majority of your time. This is no different in Starfield, as you explore hundreds of unique locations (not even counting thousands of procedurally generated), and meet all kinds of friendly, not-so-friendly, lunatic, suspicious, and funny characters along your journeys.

[b]RPG is back, but different[/b]
Starfield is a game that arguably outshines previous Bethesda titles. The scale is larger, with no sacrifices to the mechanics they've had in the past. In Fallout 4, Bethesda simplified decision-making and the RPG elements in favor of improving the gunplay which leaves the game feeling more like an adventure-shooter than an RPG. Even Skyrim could be argued, with the removal of leveling stats, reduced how much you could create your perfect character to roleplay as. In Starfield, stats/attributes do not come back. But in its place is an interesting return to the RPG roots.

While you don't have stats or attributes in Starfield (such as Strength, Intelligence, Luck, etc), it presents a different way to represent and express the kind of person you want to play as. Your background, chosen traits, leveled skills, and factions you've joined properly and consistently take control of almost every situation the game puts you in.

Skills are another new alternative to stats. New dialogue options will be available based on what skills you choose to level. Sometimes you need to let someone know you're sneakier than other people, or that you have experience in cyber security. People can even recognize if you're a well-trained pilot or gunman.

[b]Who you are matters[/b]
In the beginning, I thought this was a mere farce- an illusion. Perhaps they simply placed many opportunities early on, to show off roleplaying elements, to trick me. There's no way I would be able to use my background as a Space Scoundrel or my allegiance with the Crimson Fleet for more than just a couple dialogue options, right?

After completing three major questlines, dozens of side quests, and the main story quest, I've invested more 50 hours into Starfield over four days- an average of 12.5 hours every day. With confidence, I can report that the choices I made at character selection as well as the choices I've made during the game: who I allied with during a side quest, the factions I've decided to pledge allegiance to, the people I've killed or the people I didn't kill. All of these things felt like they mattered in countless dialogue choices. I was never worried that the character I built did not matter- the opportunities jumped at me constantly. Many times I even had to choose between the different things that defined my character in the same interaction.

One moment that really impressed me was that factions are actually consistent in Starfield. In previous Bethesda games, joining a hostile faction did not always guarantee your safety against its members. Some used excuses such as ""We may be the same faction, but all of us follow different rules."" It was a sad attempt at passing their programming (or lack thereof) for normally hostile NPCs recognizing the player as an ally. In Starfield, this is not the case. 

Minor spoilers in this paragraph. On my first playthrough, I joined the Crimson Fleet, the most notorious pirate crew among the stars. In an early mission during the main story, I had to rescue a friend from the Crimson Fleet. I entered their lair where they were holding the hostage, ready to enter a shoot-out. To my extreme but pleasant surprise, none of the pirates shot at me. I could walk up and even begin conversations with some of them. They recognized me as one of their own, and did not blink an eye at either me or my companion. I was able to reach the bottom of the lair without any conflict, and the game even properly acknowledged it. Minor spoilers end here.

[b]The rest of the game? Gunplay, crafting, and more[/b]
I started with the space exploration and RPG elements because I believe they are the most controversial and sought-after pieces of information. The rest of the game, though? Almost entirely improved over Fallout 4. The gunplay is chef's kiss (for a Bethesda game). Piloting a ship is reminiscent of No Man's Sky. Ship-building is extensive, but quite easy to start playing around with. The crafting is still simple and satisfying. Much of crafting is still locked behind skills, just like Fallout 4, but Starfield did not feel as difficult to reach as FO4 did. The handcrafted maps are arguably their most detailed and beautiful designs yet.

The balance has been very adequate for me personally. I could feel my character getting stronger, more skilled, but also enemies always provided a decent challenge. Nothing was too easy or too difficult- I never had to change difficulty from Normal mode. I've heard complaints that later on, enemies get very bullet-spongey, but I simply have never had that issue and I mainly used handguns. While there is an enormous variety of skills to pick from, leveling is fast enough where I never felt like I needed to save my skill points (as some skills have requisites to level). If I didn't meet the requirements yet, I simply leveled a different skill and waited for next level to try and improve the other skill.

[b]It's not perfect[/b]
It does miss some things their previous games did as well. But it's a Bethesda game through and through. Beautiful environments, fantastic immersion and storytelling. Fulfilling the fantasy of living in another universe, especially in space. Starfield has become a game I'd love to play again and again. Bethesda has restored my trust in them, even after the launch state of FO76 and the reduction of RPG elements in FO4. I look forward to future updates, the DLC, and TES 6.

76561197975464456,284,1716740,Starfield,"I'm torn.

This game is right up my alley. I love space. I love sci-fi. I love the traditional Bethesda nonsense. I love the potential of procedural generation. I should absolutely love this game.

And I do love a lot of things about it. I love the style. NASA-punk is a perfect description and man it works. The sound design is fantastic. The gun-play is solid. It's not mil-sim level, which I think would have been a vast improvement over the bullet-sponge RPG hybrid shooter we've got now, but it is functional.

I love the realistic planets and moons. I love how realistically barren they are. I love that the game tells me the temperature and atmospheric pressure and gravity and I love that it all makes sense. Small moon with very low gravity and no magnetosphere? No atmosphere for you. No atmosphere, no life. Some might call that excessively dry and slavish adherence to science, but I super dig that. 

I love that the game uses real elements as resources, rather than made up nonsense. I like that it combines them in fairly reasonable ways for crafting.

I love crafting, while we're on the subject. I think the ability to personalize a weapon to do exactly the job you want adds a lot to the game.

But It stumbles in a few perplexing ways.

1. People have complained in the past about a world that levels with you and it seems like Bethesda has taken that feedback to heart. As a result, you will quickly level out of large portions of the game. Enemies will be no challenge and the loot they drop of no interest. I cannot imagine that the fleeting satisfaction of stomping low-level enemies is worth losing significant portions of the game world as viable content, but that seems to be the deal that was made here.

2. It is a bit of a fast-travel simulator. I didn't really have any expectations for how this game would handle space and travel, so it wouldn't be fair to say that I'm disappointed. More that I see it as a missed opportunity. I have no doubt that the current system is the result of technical limitations, but that doesn't make it good. And it isn't good. The complaints you see about the travel system are legit. It's pretty bad and it negatively impacts the entire experience.

3. It's not as realistic as it seems like it wants to be. It's realistic enough to be irritating. You have significant limits on what you can carry, for example. It's not realistic enough to be immersive, though. When you wear a space suit, you never [i]feel[/i] like you're wearing a space suit. You don't get a helmet overlay that fogs up and casts reflections. You can't hear the sound of your own breathing. You move around completely unencumbered. Maybe I'm just a weirdo, but that pulls me right out of it.

4. The story and characters are not interesting. The writing is puerile. The characters are one-note and completely lack depth. The world itself is immensely violent, but in the most PG way. Set next to something like the Witcher games or Cyberpunk, it's kind of startling how bad Starfield is in this department.

_________________________________________________________________

At one point, I am serving as a member of law enforcement. It arises that I must apprehend a person of interest in an investigation. The game has already provided to me a weapon that incapacitates enemies. I equip such a weapon since I am law enforcement and attempt to apprehend this person of interest.

It turns out that the game didn't account for the idea that someone serving as law enforcement would want to apprehend a suspected criminal. After incapacitating the individual in question and their retinue of bodyguards, I literally could not proceed with the quest until I walked around and put a bullet in each of their brains.

Maybe it just didn't occur to the developers that police arrest people. Maybe the technical implementation of arresting people and hauling them back to your ship was seen as too much work for no real payoff. But that sequence really tipped me from ""Yeah, this is alright"" to ""Jesus what am I even playing""

This is not really a recommendation for Starfield. I'm enjoying it enough to keep playing and I suspect mods will address all (or most) of these concerns. But that will be a year or more down the line. As it stands now, I can't really recommend it without some serious caveats.

Also it runs like absolute dog shit. I'm on a 3090 and regularly get ~45 FPS in cities.

76561197989132341,677,1716740,Starfield,"If you are looking for an incredible story or some sort of Space Trucker sim this game isn't it. It's a more advanced Fallout 4 in space where the kinda cool but not super well done ideas from that game actually go somewhere. If you enjoy rooting through random places and carrying too much junk and care more about the side quests than the main plot like basically every other Bethesda game then this is good, great even. It's the most Oblivion esque game quest density wise they have made, there is so much stuff to do in every city and even some of the minor settlements had more than I expected. The Space stuff is fun but it's ultimately part of the game and not the focus and the story like Fallout 3 is serviceable but nothing special. I wouldn't really say the writing is a mixed bag as nothing has made me really roll my eyes or cringe but there has been plenty that didn't do a whole lot with the scenario / concept, It ranges from middling to fairly entertaining. For reference a game like The Outer Worlds made me cringe like crazy and I hated every single character.

I have played roughly 30 hours now and honestly don't feel like I am even close to done with the game and there is multiple of the major factions I haven't done a single quest for. The RPG elements are definitely better than Skyrim / Fallout 4 (My background as a big game hunter has surprisingly mattered quite a few times) and they finally refreshed their lock picking mini game after 15 years. The combat is refined to be an actual passable shooter now, it's not Doom Eternal or anything but you can be pretty fluid. I will also praise the perk trees. Almost everything in them is interesting and I have a hard time deciding what I want to spec into, and they made the smart move of adding challenges to get the next level so there is no more getting 100 Gun Skill by lvl 4 Like in Fallout 3 and doing Mega damage but it's not so bland and unrewarding as something like Skyrim.

I have encountered some bugs most of them were benign minor things like weird physics, NPC's acting strangely, I had my gun fail to swap once so my guy was holding air but it went away after swapping to something else. The only genuinely frustrating one I have had is there is a softlock you can get if something interrupts your conversation. One Time a giant crab murdered the person I was talking to and I couldn't do anything and had to restart, the other time it was when talking to a vendor and a quest NPC interrupted. It doesn't happen every time but its a legitimate and frustrating bug. The performance on my system has been adequate but I won't pretend this game isn't a bit of a hog.

I will say the loading screen complaint I have seen as a talking point is completely asinine. Like beyond ridiculous. You get 1-3 second loading screens when going between planets and some interiors. Specifically between planets you might get two or three quickly back to back if you are being efficient in how you go about landing and taking off then jumping to the next place but everyone bitching its breaking their immersion is just attaching themselves to the current regurgitated whining. You would think they were playing Morrowind on the original xbox or something with the multiple minute loading screens.

I don't want to get too much into the meta commentary here but it feels like most of complaints I read about Starfield are that it's a Bethesda game that is structured and plays like a Bethesda game and they don't like that or were expecting something else. Which is funny because that has basically been a huge amount of the criticism around all their releases since Skyrim really.",2023-09-09 15:40:34,145982789,1,True,False

Current playtime: 90+ hours.
//
Starting info:
For anyone interested in playing, treat this game like a fallout in space.
It is not a space flying sim that allows free flying between planets and systems.
Space travel consists of selecting a ""landing spot - planet - system"" with a short cut scene in between zones of play.
//
Load times:
3-5 seconds average (*modern nvme*)
//
Graphics:
Looks great for its scale, modern pbr materials with highly detailed models wherever you look *very dense*.
volumetric fog & atmosphere really make it look amazing. side note ""very time of day dependent"" as it does in real life.
//
Gameplay:
first-third person.
All bethesda style things one might expect: quests, encounters, guns-melee, speech, sneaking, lockpicking etc (*classics*)
Spaceship: Ship combat, Docking, ship-to-ship hailing/trading, smuggling, fully walkable/customizable ships & interiors.
Outposts: Buildable outposts, bases, storage, resource extraction, factory's, multi system outpost connection, decorations.
Customization: Ships, Spacesuits, Helmets, Boostpacks, Weapons, Outposts. almost everything.
//
Hardware & Performance:
This is a heavy game! 5600x & 3080 using 75% fsr upscaling at 4K gives me an average of 40-60 fps depending.
Amd graphics cards seem to have better optimization currently compared to nvidia. Also no nvidia driver at time of writing.
Plenty of graphics options to tweak if you need better performance, most options from medium-up look great without a significant loss of quality.
//
Tutorials:
Very lacking. Many systems are introduced and barely given any information on how they operate.
Would benefit from tooltips & side panels giving more explanation and direction.
As some systems and unlocks are hidden behind skills!
examples:
Ever wondered why you cant use a ship part? Or don't see buildings for farming and animals in your outpost?
Or what about scanning a planet for more advanced resources? Check your skill tree!
//
Scale:
Its actually immense! 90+ hours in and i only finished one side-faction questline!! There is just so much to do!! it is actually amazing the amount of voiced characters that are in this, just finding some random character in the middle of nowhere might lead to a multiple hour quest. random encounters vary from basic to interesting.
10% of planets are the highlights with a city or some main location on them or have a staryard up above the planet.
The main cities are massive, multiple times i thought i had seen it all only to find there was an elevator leading to a whole different part of it with its own area's and quests. And if you are not as interested in base building or resource gathering then you can easily see what planets have useful locations on them so you can skip most of the generated/placed locations if that's your preference.
90% of planets largely have resources & randomly placed locations and encounters on them.
But even then, some encounters can give you some pretty awesome moments & simply checking a planet for resources you need to quickly placing an outpost with some extractors on them so it can be auto-transported to your main base is useful.
//
Music & Audio:
Great! Atmospheric & immersive.
//
New-Game+:
I am told that this is its own game separate from the base sandbox & has its own systems in place and can give people new experiences even after multiple new game+'s.
Personally unverified, but interesting to see once i am done with my first playthrough.
//
Issues:
Fov slider, no dlss.
Bugs: npc's walking into stuff, strange eyes, nothing game breaking for me personally.
Your typical bethesda flavour. Makes for some funny moments so i like it like that.
//
Future:
Expansions & Modding potential of starfield is beyond anything we have seen before!

So much just isn't well thought through, underdeveloped, barely passable, lacking evolution, adaptation or innovation. I could go on but everyone has heard the critiques.

Again, QOL is not even on the game's radar. An awkward, ultimately sad, outdated game, empty and ponderous, upheld by the hopes of its fans (me), played out of obligation and a kind of nostalgic hope. Mods will improve it as many have said, but it takes a real hero to slog through this game ten times (NG+, I made it to NG2 before throwing in the towel). Sadly, I am not that hero.

I realized tonight I played this much in the hope it would somehow fulfill the desire I truly have for a game that will set the bar higher (even if just in Bethesda Land), instead of receiving another special needs bus. I can no longer make the excuses to myself I have been making. I will reinstall in a couple years and see what the modders have created to re-imagine and refine. I love my brother, but there's a whole world of well-formed games out there to discover. Perhaps that is what the Bethesda creators could have contemplated when developing a game about exploration and the limitless possibility of the human experience in an infinite multiverse.",2023-10-24 05:08:06,148766531,1,True,False
76561197961167439,238,1716740,Starfield,"Starfield is a good game, not a great game, certainly not Bethesda's best product. It's pretty much Fallout in space. There are a few game design features that make it look like No Man's Sky, but it really plays nothing like NMS and honestly makes me appreciate NMS that much more since a huge organization like Bethesda couldn't just copycat what Hello Games has accomplished.

Starfield is all about quest lines and NPC interactions. There are a few different quest lines and they are all well done with great voice acting as can be expected from Bethesda. Beyond that, nothing else really stands out as being amazing.

There are many downsides:

1) The minimum system requirements are insane. I was able to run it at mostly 30 fps on my dinosaur computer from 2012 by downloading a mod to reduce the texture size. I really don't feel like this game needed 2K textures which effectively requires players to have a serious gaming rig to play this without mods. ~$2,000 for their recommended rig.
2) The menu system is not user friendly. To be frank, it's downright horrible. It took me 25ish hours to finally learn how to maneuver in an out of the menu efficiently. I almost just stopped playing at around the 15 hour mark because the menus were so painfully un intuitive.
3) Too much fast travel. There is actually very little need to use your starship in this game. And even if you do want to fly your ship, it's not even possible in the normal sense of flying from point A to point B.
4) Too many loading screens due to the previous 'too much fast travel' issue. Now granted I have a dinosaur computer and the loading times get exaggerated as a result so this is certainly less painful the better system you play on.
5) No option for exclusive fullscreen. Really Bethesda?
6) Too many useless character skills/traits. A lot of the skills are useless due to the next bullet point.
7) Crafting is unnecessary, shipbuilding is unnecessary, outposts are unnecessary.  Hell I can even make an argument that the majority of player powers are useless. There was obviously a lot of energy and effort put into these game features that genuinely serve no useful utility in playing the main meat of the game (quest lines).
8) Stealth is laughable. No improvements have been made to stealth gameplay from any of their previous titles.

Did I have fun with the game? Yes. Would I recommend it? If you enjoy the Fallout titles, yes. Overall though, I feel like it was a step backward for the franchise.",2023-09-19 09:01:41,146575835,1,True,False

76561197996840801,193,1716740,Starfield,"A little back-story first: Morrowind was one of the first games I had ever installed on my first ever PC…my first RPG, my first open-world game and my first all-nighter…with so many firsts of my gaming life, it was also love at first sight. So I can confidently say that Bethesda games hold a special place in my heart and to be honest, with such high affection also comes high expectations

Compared to previous Bethesda titles, general stability of the game is much better. No game-breaking bugs, almost no crashes (I had 3 crashes in 100 hours which is fair enough), mostly NPC/Companion related camera angle bugs which are part of the experience at this point to be honest BUT let’s be real; this level of polish was only made possible with the resources of Microsoft not Bethesda. If not for the acquisition (which was the best possible scenario for Bethesda in my opinion), this game would be riddled with catastrophic bugs. So when it comes to polish, Microsoft definitely saved the day.

My biggest gripe with this game and in general with Bethesda is the Creation Engine. Yes, the game uses Creation Engine 2 but still, it’s the same base code since Morrowind and it shows…it definitely shows. Having an SSD is a must if you want to play this game, it’s not optional. Technically you can play it on an HDD but you WILL lose your mind. Loading screens are everywhere…I can understand different instances with fairly large interiors but small shops, houses etc. all are instanced with load screens. During one of the quests, I entered a room which was probably 2 meters by 3 meters, I spent 20 seconds in there and it was loading screen entering and loading screen exiting…why Bethesda…why?

Creation Engine definitely doesn’t meet the requirements of a modern open world game. It feels extremely bloated and it shows. Performance is all around the place; with ultra-settings I had 60 fps in taxing locations yes but I have a 4080…This is not a card that you settle with 60 fps…and if it’s like this in the high end, I don’t want to know what it’s like in the lower end. Btw, Elder Scrolls VI is also being developed with Creation Engine 2 so I have a lot of reservations about it at this point…Creation Engine needs to go Bethesda, enough is enough.

I started talking about the shortcomings of the game on purpose because almost all the negative parts of the game can be linked to the inadequacy of the game engine; facial expressions of characters for example, much better compared to previous games yes but just a month before a [i]tiny, little[/i] game called [b]Baldur’s Gate 3[/b] came into our lives and comparing the two [i](yes, I know…two games are fundamentally different but still…both are RPGs and both are AAA games, so a comparison is warranted)[/i], BG3 stands head and shoulders above Starfield. The disappointment on Wyll’s face when I refused his romantic advancements, the emotions of Minsc when he’s talking about Boo…these have stayed with me long after...In Starfield, I can recall no such memory…I romanced Sarah in my initial play-through and it was….meh…not bad but...not memorable either. BG3 gave that emotion with every single character...The [i]“feeling”[/i] Larian Studios managed to give me…I want THAT Bethesda…and it’s not happening with the Creation Engine…Again…Enough is enough…Creation Engine needs to go!

Alright…Now that’s out of the way, let’s talk about why this game deserves every single penny you spend…Yes, I know…after all I’ve said about the awful game engine, how this game can be worth any money…

Love it or hate it…they made it work…It’s still a Bethesda RPG through and through.

Don’t get me wrong; liking this game requires a specific mindset so it’s definitely not for everybody…But if you do have that specific mindset...You will have fun with this game for the foreseeable future.

First of all, main campaign was really good. It asks really fundamental questions about existence...and for answers…Let’s just say, you have to make your own deductions…nothing more, nothing less…

Side quests are also satisfactory. Faction quests were very memorable experiences and other smaller side quests definitely didn’t feel forced. I truly believe they were all hand crafted. Randomly generated quests are a plenty but the point you get them is fair and obvious so you don’t feel cheated.

Graphics are good….yes the engine is old and outdated, performance is wanting but damn you can take some seriously cool screenshots in this game.

Ship and outpost building: This is Lego…no question about it…During any part of your childhood, if you have come across Lego and fallen in love with it, this game is ‘digital Lego’. Since Fallout 4, it’s probably the best gameplay mechanic Bethesda have come up with. I don’t care about the bugs, I don’t care about anything else…I can build my own dream starship and planetary outpost…I can build a commercial empire throughout the settled systems…It might take years but I can…

For a game…any game…Replayability/gameplay loop is king and it is here, which brings me to another main point: MODS.

Modding has always been a major part of Bethesda games. I’m going a step further…modding is THE reason Bethesda is Bethesda today…Without the modding community, this company would not have become the titan it is today, so let’s give the credit where it’s due: Silent protagonists of the Bethesda story – Modders…

The main game has its flaws, yes…but even if it didn’t, modders will be modders and do their own thing…This game will be officially and unofficially updated for the foreseeable future…Until Elder Scrolls VI comes, this is it…It’s your digital Lego for the next decade.

Above, I said Starfield requires a specific mindset and this is what I meant…To love this game, you need to be a bit old school…try to fix things manually, try to change things manually…accept that things are not given with updates but taken through research.

Thinking about it…All my gripes with the game engine etc. …maybe it’s intentional…maybe…just maybe it’s part of the design…to push us brave through the starfield…to be born among the stars…one more time…

Don't get me wrong, I know that this game has lots of hate and negative reviews, but this game is basically a bunch of other games in a single one, x4 has better space economy simulation, NMS has better planet exploration and base building, Elite Dangerous has better better combat and space trading, in some parts the combat even feels like it came straight from Everspace 2. There is a big chance that if you like those games you may like doing things in this game as well, it's not the best game but like every bethesda game it's probably going to be saved by modders.

76561198070854572,10796,1716740,Starfield,"We've been hearing for years that Starfield is Bethesda's passion project, a game that they've been wanting to make even before Morrowind came out.

If this game is Bethesda's passion project, then they've lost their passion.

Plenty of reviewers are dragging Starfield for its technical issues. While it's true that Bethesda should not get a free pass on that stuff just because ""lol, they're Bethesda"", I was prepared to accept a certain level of jank if it meant experiencing an inspired world. What really kills this game is that the setting itself is deeply, relentlessly boring. It's a haphazard collage of space frontier tropes. And you know what? That could have been fine. Tropes can be effective when wielded in service of a strong creative vision. But here, there is no greater vision. There is nothing, and I mean *nothing*, to this setting beyond the tropes that serve as its foundation. 

For our major powers, we have a vaguely Western-flavored federal government, a vaguely Texan-flavored frontier alliance, a vaguely Eastern-flavored corpocracy, some scrappy pirates, and some mysterious religious zealots. There is nothing meaningful to know about any of these societies beyond whatever pictures of them you just conjured in your head. If you have an ounce of creativity, the pictures in your head are probably more detailed and compelling than the crap that made it into the game. It almost seems like these factions have been consciously sanitized, as if someone went through the first draft and removed any cultural or aesthetic identifiers beyond the baseline of ""Hey, this frontier guy wears a cowboy hat, likes guns, and has a bit of a stubborn streak!"". You'd think that the writers would be forced to come up with some creative quirks just to explain how these people adapted to their alien environments, but even that minimal level of flavor exceeds the bounds of Bethesda's vision. 

This aggressive blandness persists at every scale. We have planets that run the gamut of environmental conditions, but none of them impose meaningful gameplay changes (aside from gravity's effect on jump height, which is basically the lowest hanging fruit possible), inspire variations on the ten or so prefabricated structures that we can encounter, or even have much influence on which of the handful of flora, fauna, and feature assets can populate the game's tragically samey landscapes. One of the foundational aspects of space exploration as a genre is exploring how extreme conditions shape strategies and societies. Starfield cares so little for this relationship that it borders on immersion-breaking. I expected that Starfield would rely on repeatable assets to some extent, and that exploration would lose its shine once you've exhausted the list of things to encounter. What I didn't expect was just how short that list would be, or how sloppily curated it would be in the context of the game's environments. 

And then there's the writing. Oh goodness, the writing. The best thing I can say is that, on a micro scale, it consists of grammatically correct sentences which could plausibly be uttered by a sane human being. Beyond that, it's shot through with the same listlessness that permeates every other aspect of the game. I'll present two case studies.

I came upon a sidequest where an unknown vessel was orbiting a resort planet. Investigation reveals it to be a generation ship sent from Old Earth, back before humanity developed FTL travel. They don't take it well when you explain that their new home has already been claimed by Space Epcot. The captain asks you, some random hobo who just happened across them, to negotiate with the corpos on their behalf. They send along no observers or advocates, and don't even think to request a direct line of communication. The corpos offer you three options: blow up the ship and kill the colonists, coerce them into indentured servitude, or pay out of your own pocket to install an FTL drive aboard their ship so they can find another planet. There are no other options to advocate for the colonists. At no point does either party express any sort of cultural interest, or even basic curiosity about the other. There are no potential interactions with other factions or alternate arrangements for compensation, despite it being well-established that everything to do with Old Earth (down to the meanest paperweight) is treated as an invaluable piece of vintage history. The situation has the setup for a potentially game-changing historical event, and the most interesting thing Bethesda can squeeze from it is ""Corpos bad, are you willing to pay to feel better than them?"" If a 15th century carrack made landfall on the shores of Florida carrying the long lost descendents of Ferdinand Magellan's twin brother, I don't think Disney World's first reaction would be ""Shit, they want our land, pump 'em full of lead!""

Second case study. There's a plotline where you infiltrate the big pirate faction on behalf of the feds, right under the nose of their cunning leader and his paranoid, security-obsessed XO. So how do you stay in contact with your handlers during this delicate deep cover op? By PHYSICALLY FLYING FROM THE PIRATE BASE TO THE FEDERAL FLAGSHIP every time you complete a mission. Holy hell, are dead drops not a thing in this universe? Are the feds actively trying to give you away? During these OpSec-destroying excursions, you'll have the opportunity to turn in supplementary evidence on the pirates' many crimes. This evidence comes in the form of incriminating tapes that are just laying around in the general vicinity of the perpetrators. None of them, including the canny, wary pirate leaders, will raise objections to you stuffing said tapes into your knapsack in full view of everyone. While turning in these tapes, you'll speak to the federal XO, who repeatedly inquires as to your impressions of the pirate leader. You can either lie and say he's a nosepicking vagrant, in which case you'll be praised for your patriotism, or you can accurately inform her that he's an intelligent and charismatic figure who poses a real threat, in which case she'll chew you out for the betrayal of respecting the enemy. The questline sustains this level of cartoonishness right up to the end, where the defeated, betrayed pirate leader tells your narc ass that he's proud of you because deep down, you're the greatest pirate of all. A generous reading could paint this horrorshow as a satire of Hoover's CIA or something, but I'm not feeling very generous at the moment. 

The common thread between these two cases is apathy. These scenarios have the potential to be so interesting and memorable, and the writers probably have the chops to deliver. But instead, they just... settle for mediocrity. They're writing with the expectation that they won't be held to a high standard. Situations don't have to make sense, commentary doesn't need to be thoughtful, narrative potential doesn't yearn to be realized. Dialogue is just there to point the way towards more gameplay, so write a few words and move on to the next contrivance. More and more, I feel like Bethesda views their games as theme parks; they're not writing a story, they're building a bunch of rides and doing the minimum necessary to shuffle people from one to the other.

And now, the rides aren't even fun. Starfield uses humdrum, recycled assets to simulate a humdrum, recycled setting. None of its components do anything to support each other: not the worldbuilding, not the environments, not the gameplay, not the writing. Every part of this game talks past every other part, and if you care to listen, you'll find that they're all just rambling drunkenly about the weather. The result is a joyless, colorless mess memorable only for the lengths it goes to insult its players. Bethesda can do better than this. But they probably won't, because they don't think they have to, and apparently professional shame isn't enough of a motivator for them.",2023-12-26 11:19:12,154440607,0,True,False
76561197978166658,8874,1716740,Starfield,"I wasn't going to write this at first because I was so 50/50 on recommending it or not but after Bethesda started replying to negative reviews about why the reviews they've written are wrong I feel compelled to write something.

I would not recommend this game for $70. I would recommend waiting until the game is fully released with all of its DLCs *on* *sale* to buy it. To me there was just not enough there to justify the price. It feels like a game that's only had a few years of development rather than seven and it's just kind of under cooked.

The game itself is just boring and uninspired. It's sterile and safe, built to appeal to the widest possible audience and not offend anybody. The characters sometimes have their shining moments but for the most part are bland and your companions are the worst of these offenders because they all have the same opinion on everything, they're all the same. The characters also don't look great, they have this dead eyed uncanny valley effect to them made worse by the skyrim style zoom in whenever they talk. 

The quests themselves with the exception of a few, are so uninspired and boring and offer no moral dilemmas or require any serious thought. Compare the Ryujin quest line to the thieves guild quest line in Oblivion. With the thieves guild quest like there is a gradual progression which teaches the player not only how to be a thief but what to expect as far as how challenging a given assignment will be. Ryujin gives you three childishly easy quests that are so easy that they neither teach you how to be a thief nor give you an idea of what's to come then the difficulty meter suddenly jumps with the next quest to really quite difficult. Thankfully I happened to have enough levels saved up to dump some points into stealth otherwise I would have had to fail or just leave the quest, level up, and come back. This quest comparison also highlights another issue because Ryujin takes place in one of the saddest areas in the game, Neon.

Locations. What is Bethesdas engine really good at? It makes it relatively easy to hand craft huge worlds. So what does Starfield do? They hand crafted a few locations and left the rest up to procedural generation of course!... Oh, well... the few hand crafted locations are great right? No? Oh okay then. New Atlantis is kinda cool but it's so small, it's close to having some literal and figurative depth to it with the well but that's barely explored. New Akila looks cool but again is far too small. The Key is not a city. And Neon... Oh Jesus Christ Neon...

Neon is ""we have Nightcity from CP2077 at home."" It's suppose to be this cyberpunk, blade runner-esque city rampant with crime and drug use. You basically get the DisneyLand (not even DisneyWorld) version of that. There is no crime to witness. There are no daily schedules like Oblivion npcs had. Just the same blank faces staring at you like your cock is out but you don't know it like all the other cities. They hype up a drug that can only be bought in a particular very talked up club in Neon and the club is one of the saddest things i've ever seen in a game. It's one relatively tiny room with flashing neon lights and out of shape spandex wearing conehead cosplayers gyrating uncomfortably. Keep in mind this is one of the few hand crafted locations, pretty much everything else is procedurally generated. You also can't even smuggle the drug out for any profit, it's worth the same no matter what planet you bring it to which doesn't make any sense. So locations are not great which brings me to exploration...

Exploration in Starfield is not great. In a Fallout or an Elder Scrolls game you can stumble upon countless interesting hand crafted locations and encounters in the game to the point that getting lost is a good thing. In Starfield you won't stumble upon anything because you fast travel from planet to planet, system to system. So to explore that has to be your express goal. Okay, fine. Except everything is procedurally generated so after you've done it once you're just going to see it copy and pasted on different looking planets. You're not going to find anything new in that cave because it's the same cave. You're not going to find anything interesting on that planet because it's going to have the same stuff as the last one, just with different plants around it and the grounds a different color. Just go system to system looking for content until you get bored with that. They made some decent random encounters that you can have while out in space but not enough of them, I've run into Grandma half a dozen times by now.

And as far as things to do... the ending: Spoilers ahead obviously. It's another multiverse story. I understand 7 years ago when the game began development this concept wasn't quite as tired and cliche as it has become but good God am I sick of multiverses. The whole point of the game is to just replay it again, that's how it ends. I wish I was joking. It's message is basically it's not about the destination, it's about the journey, which is fine but the journey is not good... Unfortunately the game has, to me, no replayability until new content in the form of DLC drops. Which I may not even buy until it goes on sale because I just don't care. The story is that uninteresting. 

This is not to say that everything about Starfield is bad. The gun play is actually pretty great though not worth it alone to buy the game. The ship building is actually really fun despite it being janky, probably some of the most fun i've had in the game. Some of the quests are fun like the UC quest line and other shorter, one off quests. They all have the same problems though: if they do offer any interesting ideas they do not fully explore them, they acknowledge them and that's about it. Things like the Well, tensions between the UC and Rangers, and the UC being a fascist state are all explored in only the most superficial terms. Bethesda has always had the problem of being wide as a lake but deep as a puddle and Starfield is unfortunately a prime example of how this problem has only gotten worse with every subsequent Bethesda release since Morrowind. 

I did enjoy parts of this game but I cannot recommend it for $70. It is so frustrating to see Bethesda finally get a crack at creating a unique IP that isn't another Elder Scrolls or Fallout game and they make this boring, uninspired whimper of a game. This game is all of Bethesdas bad habits, everything they're bad at and nothing they're good at, finely distilled. 

One of the most frustrating things to me is that this game is mediocre, it's not bad like No Mans Sky and it didn't ruin Bethesdas reputation like CP2077 did on release so it's not going to get the attention it needs to be made into great game like those studios did. Chances are post launch will be handled very much like FO4 where we'll get a couple of bug fixes but not nearly enough and a couple of nickle and dime DLCS then one or two really solid ones. They have ES6 to get to work on after all. This means the game will probably not have a miracle come back like those games did and will probably always be mediocre, which I think is a shame because it does have good bones there's just no meat on them.",2023-11-29 01:50:32,152483294,0,True,False

In New Atlantis, the capitol village-I mean ""city"" of the United Colonies, the supposed biggest star nation in the setting, you see fully armored riot looking cops patrolling everywhere, then you go down to the Well, the admittedly neat looking pseudo-undercity of New Atlantis, and see graffiti of a UC soldier executing someone with ""all hail our benevolent overlords"" written sardonically besides it. That paired with loading screen hits of ther UC having ""Maybe too many laws"" you'd think that this was setting up that the shiny, Star Trek Looking faction that has draped itself in ""Good Guy Space America"" may have a dark side, even before you find out that they are legit doing United Citizen Federation shit of haivng citizenship needing to be earned and necessary for owning a home and other basic things. But then something weird happens....nothing happens, even when you find out a moderate twist during their faction missions, the UC keeps being just a bunch of goody goody folks who just wanna protect civilians. All that lead up of a sinister side is just window dressing.

I thought things would be better once I hit Neon, a City built like a massive oil platform on an ocean planet covered in holograms and neon lights and supposidly riddled with crime and drugs like a nautical Night City? I could not get my spacer ass over there fast enough! It even looked great at first with the lightning strikes hitting the city's sheild, the guards making sure that nobody smuggles out the dangerously addictive drugs that are legal inside the city, all the way to the smokey cyberpunk/nautical town looking streets. But just like New Atlantis and the UC, all this talk of Neon being a dangerous and risky place with crime and corruption all over was just that, a bunch of talk as the place ended up quickly feeling more like a suburban strip mall with bad weather and some corporate branded graffiti to try and look 'street'. 

After finishing a questline for the most friendly and well behaved gang ever I set course for the Freestar collective, maybe some space weastern, Serenety style feels would finally immerse me in this game I paid eeventy real life dollars for. Akila City was less offensive in it's broken promises than the previous cities, it sure did feel and look like a sort of Star Wars/Serenity space weastern pastiche and even had a old timey bank robbery going on. But like the rest, all the talk of the super dangerous wildlife constantly at the walls like they were on a death world went unfulfilled in any meaningful way. 

The rest of the game feels the same, sterile and safe, pirates who talk cringingly about how they are gonna totally betray you and oh you better not cross them sonny jim but come accross like teenagers from a gated community trying to act hard. Sterile and constantly touching on themes and ideas that it later forgets, Starfield could not make an immersive world if it tried, and thats why after playing through the entire damn thing the most fun I found was helping a clone of Gengis Khan stage a prison break against a clone of FDR and an Egyptian queen because at least that was bafflingly amusing. Seriously if you want a fun space RPG, go play the Outer worlds, it takes you about 30 hours maybe to finish everything but damned if it didn't make me legit feel like a han solo type.

In short: a barren wasteland painted with a layer of gold.

When I first launched this game, I was ecstatic. I couldn't WAIT to delve into the world(s) of Starfield. The opening visuals took my breath away, I loved the customization, I loved how real everything looked, I just fell in love, and that was all before even boarding the first ship. I was in awe when I first entered it, slowly going over and admiring all the little details and quirks. It didn't just look like a mode of transportation, it looked like somebodies home. It looked lived in. I made my way to the cockpit, and while I didn't know it at the time, this would be the first dent in Starfield's armor. I navigated my way to Kreet. The navigation had its charms at first but as I got further into the game, it went from a charming afterthought to an actual annoyance just to travel from planet to planet (I find the label ""fast travel simulator"" accurate). I landed on Kreet and made my way inside the research station. I did not know it but once again, this was another dent in the armor of Starfield that would come into play later. I cleared the base, completed the objective, made my way to New Atlantis and the real gameplay truly began.

I was still in love with the game. So excited to do quests, fight enemies, customize my own ship, all of that. I was ecstatic. What first began to wear on me was the space travel and travel between planets. As I said earlier, it went from a charm to a dreaded annoyance. Was it the worst thing ever? Absolutely not, but neither was it anything remotely innovative or entertaining. It was a literal chore. What next began to take a toll on me was the planets and their layouts and terrain. They were by no means bad, but just came off as generic. You go from place to place to place and eventually realize all that's changing is the weather and gravity. At this point I still liked the game but was starting to see some flaws. Then came the generic enemies. There's really no easy way to put it, you go literally anywhere in the galaxy and you're either fighting A) Spacers, B) Pirates or C) other. That's it. There is almost no variation whatsoever. Next were some bugs. To be clear, I did not encounter nearly as many bugs as some others have, but I had my fair share. NPC's glitching through floors and walls, items floating in mid air or just not loading in at all, the usual from Bethesda. Next were the quests. There were some decent ones that I enjoyed doing but for the most part, it was just classic Bethesda: go kill this enemy, go fetch this item, go tell this person something, come back and get your money. Also, the story, as I experienced so far at least, is less than ideal. I wouldn't say it's bad, but I am a big fan of story games and whatever the plot of this game is, it ain't it.

At this point I was no longer viewing the game through rose colored glasses, the honeymoon had worn off but I still had hope... until the biggest issues I encountered arose. The most prominent was how planets and enemy outposts and whatnot generated. On paper, it sounds really cool: over 1,000 planets, many of them procedurally generated. That should allow a ton of variation and uniqueness, right? Well, like I said, on paper, yes. But in practice, it is some of the most lazy game design there is. Like many things in Starfield, it seems cool at first but the interest and joy quickly fades the more planets you visit and the more you realize it's basically all the same. You'll encounter the same bases, the same landmarks, the same everything, which leads me into what killed the game for me: copy and pasted base layouts. Remember when I went to Kreet earlier and did that mission? Well that first base left an impression on me because well, obviously it's the first base you find. Well hours later, I came across another base on a separate moon... with the exact same layout. And when I say exact same, I mean EXACT same, down to dead NPC's, item placement, in some situations loot, everything. At first I thought, ""Hey, it's a MASSIVE game. Surely I'm going to encounter a little copy and paste, that's OK"". And it was OK... the first time. And then it happened again. And again. And again. And again. And again. There were only a few base variations and they'd simply copy and paste over to their procedurally generated area and that's where the real dagger happened. The pinpointed moment where I realized what I was playing. I was on some moon, don't even remember the name (does it matter? They're all the same), doing a mission. I finish clearing a small base when I see a marker on the map for a cave like 800 meters away. Figure what the hell, I've got time and inventory space, let's go clear out this cave. It was a base in the side of a mountain, if you have any meaningful amount of time in the game, you'll know exactly the type of base layout I mean: equipment and stuff outside, a guard or two keeping watch and when you enter the cave, there's a tunnel leading to a big cavern with enemies which in turn leads to an even larger cavern with an inoperable elevator and more enemies. I had seen this layout 5 or 6 times now but whatever. Cleared it out, grabbed my loot and went back outside. I saw another marker on my map 300 meters away, figured I'd go check that one out too. I make my way over to the other side of this mountain and what do I see? The same exact base, copy and pasted 300 meters away. Same enemies, same enemy layout, same items and loot, same everything. It was literally the exact same. And that was it. That was the moment the curtain fell and I realized what I was getting into.

It's all a big smoke and mirrors show. An illusion. That's really all I can describe it as. Say what you will about Skyrim or Fallout 4 (and trust me, there's plenty to criticize) but at least each building, each interior, each cave was handcrafted, not this regurgitated drivel. There's no life to it, no soul, no personality. It's like if you told an AI to make an infinite space science fiction RPG for the masses. And to be clear, that's who Starfield is for: the masses. Same with the earlier mentioned Skyrim and Fallout 4, Bethesda is no longer making challenging games with interesting dialogue and compelling stories. It's all watered down, streamlined, easily consumable slop for the masses and Starfield is the epitome of that.

ALL THAT BEING SAID, I would like to highlight some positives. While there aren't many, I'd feel remiss not mentioning them. Firstly for me are the graphics. While they're by no means out of this world (pun slightly intended), they still look fantastic. There's also atmosphere. As I said earlier with ships, they don't just look like modes of transportation. While it's all mostly eye candy, the amount of detail that goes into just the small, minute things is what really gets me. I do also enjoy the combat and gunplay. While guns still have that Bethesda feel to them, they still work well and there's a wide variety to choose from. There's also a ton of customization. If there's a singular positive thing about the game I'd like to highlight, it's ship customization. Granted, while a large portion of it is purely cosmetic and won't impact gameplay, the ship customization is fantastic.

In its present state, I'd give Starfield a 3/10 and could not in good conscience recommend it to anyone. It's a shell of what was promised and honestly keeps me in fear of what The Elder Scrolls 6 will be like and I hope Bethesda learns from this and takes steps to remedy it in future games. I can only hope it receives similar quality of life updates to No Man's Sky and Cyberpunk and is brought back from the brink. However, considering how Bethesda reacted to criticism, I'm not holding my breath though.",2024-01-17 12:30:31,156162700,0,True,False

• Good amount of diverse activities you can engage into.

• Solid visuals, with particular attention to environmental and open-world details. On max settings, it looks spectacular.

• Progression feels somewhat satisfying for the first 20-30 hours.

• For a Bethesda game, the amount of severe bugs and technical issues is much lower than expected.
[/td]
[td]
• Unengaging main story, encompassed by one-sided, forgettable characters you likely won’t relate to, or get a feeling for, at any point.

• Enormous amount of recycled / copy-pasted content, including 1:1 copies of locations that, on paper, should be unique. 

• Long-term progression lacks incentive; it’s, essentially, a constantly-diminishing return in all aspects, that becomes a tedious slog without a satisfying goal.

• Space combat lacks depth, feels shallow, and boils down to a flat ‘DPS-check’ trade of blows between ships most of the time.

• Getting most things done is a cumbersome affair due to the high amount of loading screens, unskippable transition animations and clunky, formulaic UI layouts.

• Power creep issues in later-game: even on Very Hard, you’ll be able to steamroll enemies 30 levels above you without much issue, with any half-decent build.

[h1]In-Depth[/h1]
[h3]Writing & Worldbuilding[/h3]
Starting as a miner nobody on a remote planet, your run-of-the-mill ‘deus-ex-machina’ starts when you happen to stumble on a mysterious alien artifact that, coincidentally enough, seems to attune to your person with yet-unknown consequences. MAGIC! It’s the same trope of Skyrim’s Dragonborn, only much less cooler because this time you have a rusted piece of alien metal instead of dragon souls sniffing. And you’re dubbed ‘Starborn’ not long afterwards, because Bethesda writers have a LOT of imagination. From there your journey through the stars starts yadda-yadda-ya - use the Force, Luke, and so on. Boring.

Everything from locations to quests, characters, companions and villains feel terribly generic, underwhelming and soulless. Not once in my nearly 70 hours have I said, in my head, ‘now THIS is interesting’ - or cool, or deep, or mysterious enough to interest me. That’s not going to happen, because trying to please everyone with cookie cutter narratives and character designs ends up pleasing NO ONE. 

The world looks cool, and is visually fantastic in its details, especially out in the wild. Interiors, ships and general indoors locations, save for a few, feel generic and same-y, and don’t have the same level of interactivity seen in previous Bethesda games. They even removed the gore system everyone loved. The attempt at a ‘late-hard-sci-fi’ universe fails miserably, because it’s not nearly gritty enough, and doesn’t take itself seriously enough, to be fitting for a true ‘hard sci fi’.

[h3]Exploration & Secrets[/h3]
You’ll explore the galaxy using your ship, jumping from system to system, able to land on pretty much any planet that has solid ground. Once disembarked, you’ll proceed on foot and, if you have the right perk, move faster with the aid of a jump pack for additional jump reach and better mobility. Reaching most locations is a tiresome affair, since your running speed will be very slow compared to the distance you’ll have to cross - with very little of interest between you and the next map marker. 

Forget all the interesting random encounters of Fallout or Elder Scrolls, those won’t happen on these barren planets. Points of interest range from small outposts to multi-layered facilities, often filled with enemies, containers, loot, locked doors, terminals with lore - the usual. They’re interesting to explore the first time around, however the massive amount of copy-pasting will make them tiresome soon, since very few truly unique ones exist outside of questlines. 

Exploration is compounded with a surveying system allowing you to painstakingly scan all resources, animals, elements and flora of each planet and then sell the data for a pittance - that’s not worth doing and takes ages. There are some secrets in the form of hidden locations discoverable only by reading specific documents, or hidden containers inside POIs, but they’re usually underwhelming - exceptions apply.

[h3]Combat System & Bosses[/h3]
You’ll be able to use a variety of weapons that either deal physical, energy or EM (stun) damage, and also modify them via workbenches - same goes for armor parts. There are rarity tiers that add passive properties, although most of them are gimmicks not worth grinding Legendary Enemies for. The problem with weapons in Starfield is that they feel too similar to one another, and even ‘unique’ named ones are just normal guns with pre-set modifications and affixes, none of them is TRULY something one of a kind you can’t find anywhere else, powerful and sublime to look for. 

Combat gunplay is fine, somewhat on the same level of Fallout 4, but less dynamic, with worse AI, and less gore / impact feel from shots. All enemies you’ll face feel the same, behave the same and LOOK the same because 90% of the time everyone wears spacesuits, even while inside. Except in cities. Companions are brainless meat-shields only useful to carry additional cargo, and the enemy AI is so dumb you’ll have a cake walk if you use a stealth build or just use basic cover. You’ll eventually acquire special powers due to your “chosen” status, which are memes I never really found useful. I’ve fought a total ONE unique boss in 70 hours in a specific quest, the rest were just oversized / renamed / reskinned generic enemies over and over again. FillerField.

[h3]Companions & Quests[/h3]
Companions are one sided-flat and cringe in most cases. They don’t really seem to react to your personal dispositions in meaningful ways, or to your actions, and when they actually do, you can always persuade them to stick with you for the sake of the plot - God forbid actual freedom of choice. Remember how in say, New Vegas, companions ditched you if you behaved against their values or beliefs, or allied with a faction they hated? That’s not going to happen here, and there isn’t even a Faction reputation system to begin with.",2024-03-31 12:21:28,161871675,0,True,False

A game about exploration that delivers the thrill of opening your menu, selecting the fast travel option, clicking to fast travel to a star system, loading, then opening your menu, clicking to fast travel to a planet, loading, then answering the same NPC dialogue at every planet before you're treated to another loading screen to finally land on planet.

An immersive RPG in which every door in every colony is a loading screen and firing an infinite stream of bullets around citizens heads in the middle of the city is apparently just another Tuesday in America for the New Atlantians as they, completely unbothered by the frag grenades going off all around them, continue to partake in every colonists favorite activity -- walking aimlessly into walls.

A game which offers swashbuckling adventures in which successfully stealing a ship is as easy as killing 5 brainless NPCs. The payoff is possibly the most accurate Gamestop trade-in simulator ever made. It costs 20k to ""register"" the ship, the ship only sells for 22k and once you've collected your pittance, you'll see the exact same ship on the market with an asking price of 500k from the guy that gave you 2k for it.

A game bursting with content in which each outpost and mission are functionally the same as the first 10 you play and you'll be asked to do them all 100+ times with almost zero variation. Honestly, after the first 20 hours, Starfield practically begs you to save yourself 120GBs of storage space and forget it exists.

A gripping story-line in which every character is as exciting as the bread isle in the grocery store and none of your choices matter. Seriously, exactly which brand of white bread you take home with you from the grocery store has more serious consequences than literally any decision Starfield asks the player to make. ""White or Wheat?"" is a more thrilling dilemma than anything in Starfield's narrative.

A ground-breaking new IP that tries its hardest to be exactly like its sister IPs while utterly failing to deliver a fraction of their charm or greatness. This is easily the most disappointing Bethesda title ever made, including ""Elder Scrolls Blades,"" because at least no one cared about, wanted, or had any expectations for a mobile title. It genuinely feels like, at some point in development, the list of ""Good Ideas for Starfield,"" and ""Bad Ideas for Starfield,"" got swapped and they made the worst possible version of Starfield that could be made.

Fr tho, it was just boring. The weak exploration (both on planet and in space), weak dialogue and mid gameplay, made this game feel like such a downgrade from previous Bethesda titles. 

A quick example would be the  how you would gain powers in this game and a game like Skyrim. In Skyrim, to gain the dragon shout abilities you would need to: 
a) find a word wall to learn the shout, these would be scattered around the map in dungeons and hard to get to places, often guarded by a puzzle or enemies. 
b) Kill a dragon to absorb its soul to actually use the shout. You had to do this 2 more times to level up one shout completely. 
Now in Starfield you would need to, get the coordinates of the alien ruins from a space station, go to the coordinates, walk a couple of minutes to the same procedural generated ruin, then float and touch some star dust.

As a AAA game studio, Bethesda needs to grow and evolve, instead I feel they went backwards and stuck to their comfort zone. As a result the industry moved on and they got left behind. There are better games with better open worlds, better storylines, better gameplay, and better ideas.  

Get this game on sale, but don't expect a quick lift off to the stars, you'll probably get hit by a loading screen or two on the way.",2024-02-28 10:32:36,159458191,0,True,False

76561198089168523,4566,1716740,Starfield,"I never in my life thought that I would write a negative review for a BGS game. The magic of BGS games is it makes you feel big in a big world. This game makes you feel small in a small world that is pretending to be big. That magic feeling of go anywhere, be anyone, do whatever you want, choose any side you desire is...gone. We love BGS games because the world, the freedom, and the lore makes up for whatever the main story lacks, nobody buys BGS games for the awesome story, we buy them for the awesome world, freedom, and lore. We get the games to make the worlds ""our"" worlds and that's the Bethesda magic this game doesn't have.  This game just doesn't have any of that. It does in theory but not in practice. The story-line is very linear and forced. Your actions don't really matter at all. You can't help any faction win over any other in any kind of meaningful way, You cannot shape the game world. 

The game world is small, pretending to be big. See big space, load screen into small area, but there are a lot of small areas, and load screens. The game somehow feels smaller than Fallout 4. In previous titles the story was an accessory to the game world.  In this game the game world is an accessory to the story.   

It's almost like they cared too much about trying to prove that they could write a better story and in the process lost sight of what people love about their games and lost the magic. This game is good for one, maybe two playthroughs and that's it. All of your companions are good guys, you're heavily forced into this constellation group, you're going to play the exact same story over and over, and over again with goody companions scolding you. The roleplay value of this game compared to Fallout or Skyrim is abysmal, like terrible bad. It feels like you're playing a poor man's version of Cyberpunk or mass effect. Is the main story better than fallout or Skyrim? Yes, a little in quality, but nobody gives a ---- about that in your games, you lose the freedom of shaping the game world to make it ""your"" world. It's a decent linear game set in a kinda open world with the illusion of choice and very little consequence.  

Bethesda, you missed the mark and lost the magic big time. Give us back the open world setting full of conflict and warring factions where we have the freedom to be who we want and shape the outcome of the game to ""our"" liking, ""our"" way, making it ""our"" game. Nobody cares about your ""artistic vision"" of a mediocre, linear, repetitive story filled with cookie cutter nice person companions and no real consequences or world shaping.

76561198021405183,1540,1716740,Starfield,"My friends and I have a separate channel in our Discord server where we rant about problems with the game. We do so multiple times a week.

When I first jumped into this game, I was amazed. So much to do and so much to explore! It felt great. Like I was on the cusp of some fantastic new adventure.

But it didn't last - you knew this was coming. From the outside and when you just dip your finger in, it certainly looks like there's a lot to Starfield, but you eventually realise that there really isn't. A mile wide and an inch deep encapsulates this game perfectly.

There are good things about Starfield, make no mistake. But nearly without fail, it's stunted by the bad things and prevented from actually being great. Let's look at an example: shipbuilding in this game is really fun. You can look at what so many players have managed to create. That's where it ends, though, because as with many other things here - THERE'S NOTHING TO IT. Your ship is basically a glorified fast travel terminal. 

There's also outpost building. It seems really cool, you know, going out there into the vast unknown and building your own little slice of home there. But, again, THERE'S NOTHING TO IT. Once you build your first one just to see how cool it is, you quickly realise that there isn't really any more of a point to doing so.

That brings me nicely to exploration. Who the hell at Bethesda played this and thought ""hey, it will be fun!"" because it isn't. You can't land wherever you want on the planet as you can in, say, No Man's Sky. You have to point at where you want on the map, and then through a few loading screens, you finally arrive into your allotted fishbowl. I call it a fishbowl because that's precisely what it is, and it's not a particularly interesting one either. You slow jog around for a while to see the usual points of interest that are replicated on every other planet in the game, no matter its character, from supposedly civilised and settled ones, all the way to the ones which are supposed to be more 'undiscovered'. No matter what, you'll find all the same things. It's especially puzzling when it comes to the temples in game - a temple that has supposedly been undiscovered for centuries by humans is only a few hundred metres away from a human settlement of some form. It simply makes no sense. Then after slow jogging around this fishbowl, you will be hit with an invisible wall. Oh, and did I mention that it has no land vehicles of any sort? What the hell is a space exploration game without a space buggy? I also don't think I need to mention that it's unacceptable to have so many loading screens from a game released in 2023.

I can't begin to state how much of a better design decision it would have been for Starfield to have only a few planets that were handcrafted without invisible walls or random generation, or at least, that kept to a minimum. But they sold that away for the ""1,000 planets"" marketing gimmick. Beautiful handcrafted worlds are the bread and butter of Bethesda's games. It's why we love them and more importantly, why we put up with the bugs and the other misgivings. Without that, what does the game have? Nothing. And that's where we're at with Starfield.

In general, I feel that Bethesda may have just lost it. Other game companies have put out far superior titles with features that are better than in Starfield, or they're actually present in the first place. It's like they're sitting on a sugar high from the Skyrim days (and even then, the game has actually gone backwards in several respects). They need to wake up and move on, because everyone else has. They also talk about how this game is their 'passion project' that they've wanted to make since Morrowind.

Starfield is not a game worth paying for. At every level of game design it falls flat. For example:

[b]Gameplay[/b]
[list]
[*]The gameplay loop is very empty. It's almost entirely fetch quests that take you to uninteresting locations, locations that cannot be traveled to in any other way than fast travelling, which itself is tedious and functionally a loading screen.
[*]Quests can usually only be completed in one way, there is no variation in the ways you can approach a situation.
[*]Combat is simple and unrewarding. The gun play is passable, but that is the only viable build. Melee exists, and that's about all that can be said about it. Stealth exists for the first shot fired, and excluding a specific questline, has no other purpose; it is simply a modifier to the above gunplay.
[*]Enemies scale to your level, there is no sense of progression. Any likewise leveled weapons only exist to keep pace with the increased health of bullet-sponge enemies. Never will you feel like you are more powerful, or that you are fighting a different fight than the last.
[*]There are four kinds of enemies, humans, robots, fauna, and turrets. Humans are either pirates, spacers, or fanatics. Robots behave like humans, and all variants behave exactly the same way, requiring no change in methodology than run/shoot. Fauna behave like animals, and outside of one questline, never actually have to be engaged.
[*]Combine both points above and you have one kind of fight, all of the time. There is no variation in combat whatsoever.
[*]Space combat is passable, but all ships behave the same way. You can build something tanky or something maneuverable, but it makes little difference in the fights themselves. Ship building is mostly an aesthetic exercise.
[*]There is no point in the crafting or outpost building mechanics. They give you no real advantages, its nothing but menu hopping, and are completely unnecessary for either survival or integrated quests. Were it not for the activity prompt telling you that it exists, you would never notice it or think you've missed something (you haven't).
[*]Regarding main story abilities, the process for acquiring them is likewise extremely tedious, repetitive, and unrewarding.

[b]Exploration[/b]
[list]
[*]The galaxy is extremely empty. Each planet, including the major ""settled"" planets, are simply procedurally generated empty spaces. You have to ""fly"" to them, which just consists of opening the map, cycling though the star-system-planet menu, and fast travel to them. There is no way to travel to them manually, and nothing to see along the way.
[*]You will occasionally have a random encounter in the orbit of the planet as you arrive to it. This is often just ship combat with pirates, but you will occasionally meet a friendly ship with two or three lines of dialog. That's it.
[*]There are four major cities, and an equal number of minor settlements. These are very small, and likewise devoid of life or points of interest. One city is a giant airport terminal. One city is a western themed potemkin village. One city is a hole in the ground. The only interesting city is Neon, the cyberpunk oil platform. The minor settlements are a few empty buildings that only exist as destinations for one or two fetch quests.
[*]The outpost dungeons are repetitive, literally copy and pasted locations that have the exact same loot, enemies, and written notes. If you've visited one type, you seen all there is of it. There are maybe seven different types.
[*]The loot is leveled and even ""unique"" weapons are visually and functionally identical to their base models. There is no point in collecting them, or displaying them other than their name.
[*]All this works out to make exploration an entirely unrewarding experience of sitting though take off/grav jump/landing cutscenes and menu hopping in between, with nothing to show or do at the end of the time wasted doing this.
[/list]

[b]Quests, Characters, and Writing[/b]
[list]
[*]There are a few good questlines, with an emphasis on few. Some are interesting, but are mostly padded out by intervening fetch quests. While those few are fun at parts, their biggest effect is highlighting how boring and meaningless other ""major"" questlines are. Thoughtful storytelling and interesting plots were possible, but reserved for only a handful of questlines. The main quest is not one of them.
[*]Side quests that aren't fetch quests or at least are well disguised fetch quests can also be interesting, but often are not. You can stumble on a few of these through exploration.
[*]The number of quests is woefully small. It cannot be more than twenty, if you don't count each and every objective as individual quests. This compounds the feeling of emptiness. In freeform exploration, there is nothing to do. In major hubs, there is very little to do.
[*]There is no faction lockout, no allegiance or faction system. You can do everything in one playthrough. There is nothing that would make you want to replay the game once you've done all there is to do; no trying a new build, no exploring a new faction. This is especially ironic at the end of the game.
[*]The characters all share basically the same worldview, and there is no tension between them or the player character. There is always an objective ""right"" choice, and an objective ""wrong"" choice, and no benefit to choosing the wrong choice.
[*]The writing for the characters is basically one dimensional. Few characters will be remembered after you've interacted with them. Once you've resolved their problem of having left their coffee mug in another star system, they stop existing as anything other than a faceless NPC. Once or twice you will be recognized as someone who did anything, for a single line of dialogue.
[*]Each story is entirely self contained. There is no wider impact on the galaxy writ small, and when a questline is over, you will be unable to tell if you ever completed it at all. There is no sense of life, response, or consequence to your actions.
[*]Procedurally generated quests are go here, grab that, go there, shoot that, or haul resources for me. These usually take you to one of the given set of outpost locations, which, when combined with the painful lack of variety of locations, means you will be going to the same place over and over again.
[*]Without spoilers, the completion of the main quest will make each and every above point painfully exaggerated.

[b]Conclusion[/b]
Starfield is a major step back not just from the general gaming industry, the RPG genre, but Bethesda themselves. It is entirely unclear what was being done during the exaggerated development time and with all the money spent on it. There is less to do than in Fallout 4. There is less to do than in one hold of Skyrim. There is less to do than in independently developed early access games. When compared to other games that have released not just around the same time, but years prior, and from Bethesda themselves, it is insultingly disappointing. Any modder looking to ""fix"" the game would better spend their time developing a new one from scratch, there simply isn't enough to build off of to make it worthwhile.

76561198044870434,9026,1716740,Starfield,"I rate Starfield 5.5/10 (An ok if mediocre BGS game that has its moments, but feels like a regression in quality from previous BGS titles).

Starfield as an adventure/RPG is quite poor. Starfield as an FPS is fun. After I finished the bulk of quests, I'm just turning my brain off and enjoying the FPS gunplay, combat in low gravity/zero-g.

That being said, so many features of Starfield leave you scratching your head thinking, ""really?"" No brainer QOL features from previous Bethesda titles are absent, and the gameplay features they DID use in Starfield are weak/poorly thought out/shoe-horned in/rushed for the deadline.

I'm guessing it was top-down decision making mismanagement that made Starfield feel like a regression in quality instead of playing on strengths found in prior Bethesda games. 

There's EM weapons, ship's brig components, contraband/ smuggling system that FEELS like they should have had greater functionality and purpose, but someone met with the dev team for those systems and said ""we gotta ship this game, send it as-is."" And so you're left with gameplay mechanics that are TECHNICALLY there... but are functionally worthless and don't add to the game in a meaningful way.

That's just one example. I really think the lead developers/project managers made having 1000 procedurally generated planets THE CORE concept of the game, Which means that the rest of the gameplay mechanics are half-baked because they spent the majority of development on having 1000 procedurally generated, uninteresting planets, rather than focusing on exploration/worldbuilding/environmental storytelling, which were the STRONGEST parts of previous BGS titles. There's little reward for players to actually explore!


- Starfield is a mile wide and an inch deep.

-Story, quests & lore feel half-hearted, cut short for time and bland. 

-Bethesda created the lore for this game, and chose the most boring time to start your adventure. Colony wars are over! No mechs or armies with weaponized aliens. 

The citizens, guards, etc.. from the 2 main factions complain about each other but they're at peace. You can complete all the quests for one faction, join the next and do all the quests, and join the space pirates and do all their quests and it doesn't effect the story at all! I thought BGS would have learned what game mechanics from their previous titles worked well that players enjoyed and implement them in Starfield. I had hoped we'd get something like Skyrim or F:NV where there'd be consequences to your choices (Gain positive reputation with a faction that puts you in poor standing/locks you out from faction questlines and other locations under a faction) but the game world feels Anaemic and unresponsive to Player actions and decisions.

 -game systems that seemed to have some purpose somewhere along development but were made completely redundant by full release

 (crafting, cooking/food, smuggling contraband,shipbuilding, resource collection/mining, colonies, spaceship fuel/grav jump range, stealth)

- more than half the skills are unnecessary, and quite a lot of grinding is required to level up skil

-Poor U.I 

-Powers are pointless; I only use ""personal atmosphere"" to give myself oxygen because I'm constantly over encumbered hauling only resources and loot to and from my ship

-you'll spend an hour in real time trying to sell 40,000 credits worth of loot to 6 different merchants who only have 5000 credits on hand (and the trade authority vendors, who have 12,000 credits). Selling 3-4 guns will give you every credit the vendor has on hand. You'll Have to find a bench to sit on, wait 48hrs for them to restock. And unlike previous games, a maxxed out commerce skill does NOT give you the option to invest a sum of credits with a vendor to increase their buying capacity.

-Say you want to use ammo as a second currency with vendors; you buy up all the ammo a vendor has, and sell loot to get your credits back. The U.I doesn't speed up the selection of the quantity of ammo/meds/resources you wish to sell like previous Bethesda games, so you can hold down the left thumbstick for half an hour to sell the amount that'll clear the vendor of their credits, or you can give them ALL of a stack of ammo/meds/resources saving you time, but giving the surplus value away to a vendor for free.

-I'd like to use the Bridger grenade launcher, except only some gun shops carry 40mm ammo and between 3-25 at any time. So I spend a bunch of time sitting on a bench and waiting 48hrs for them to restock, buy out all the 40mm and wait another 48hrs. Bleh

-It feels pointless to explore planets. No matter where you land, you're always 500m from the exact same abandoned robotics lab, mining outpost, frozen research station. Seriously, for a 2023 title, I know the layout of every dungeon because there's only like a dozen of them! Enemies spawn in the same places everytime, loot is found in the same places, the 3rd locker down on the left always has credsticks on its shelf.. it's pathetic. Skyrim had hundreds of unique dungeons within one province of Tamriel and STARFIELD with hundreds of empty planets and moons only has a dozen or so dungeons that are found on every planet and moon. You'll know every time where enemies spawn, where keycards spawn, where safes and contraband spawns...

-research base
-underground frozen research base
-mining facility with vats of lava
-the tall research base with the elevator
-abandoned robotics facility (with notes on how the staff were using the robots to deliver coffee)
-deeper mining facility

-you'll face either spacers, crimson fleet pirates, ecliptic mercs, or var'uun heretics at any of the dozen locations. For all intents and purposes, they are completely the same (behaviour in combat)

Whats the point of a big open world if there's nothing interesting inside?

It feels like I bought a tall glass of juice but the waiter drank 75% of it before watering it down and giving it to me for $90 CAD ($110 after tax)

In conclusion, this is a step down in quality from Bethesda compared to previous titles. Bethesda took the best gameplay mechanics from their previous games, removed the QOL mechanics and half assed shoe horned the others into Starfield. It feels like the game is underdeveloped, rushed to completion, overhyped, and absolutely disappointing for a 2023 title from a triple A game studio.

I'd wait a year or two for the game to go on sale.. it wouldn't feel right to pay more than $30 for the game (don't spend $90+ like I did on Starfield!)

That being said, If Bethesda listens to player feedback and provides free, meaningful updates I will update my review accordingly. For the time being, I'm not interested in paying more for additional DLC when the base game at full price feels incomplete.",2023-09-26 22:44:46,147081201,0,True,False
76561197961270473,1343,1716740,Starfield,"After dedicating countless hours to creating mods for Skyrim and Fallout 4, amassing over 5 million downloads, it pains me to announce to my modding community: I won't be modding for Starfield. I'm at a loss to comprehend Bethesda's direction. In an era graced by masterpieces like Cyberpunk 2077, Red Dead Redemption II, Elden Ring, and Baldur's Gate, Bethesda has somehow managed to release a game that feels archaic, lackluster, and painfully underwhelming. The game's script is lackadaisical, the gameplay lethargic, and the overall experience is profoundly uninspiring. It's a far cry from the innovative standards set in 2023/24.

This weekend, as I pen this review, the player counts speak volumes:

Starfield: 20,027 players
Fallout 4: 20,089 players
Skyrim SE: 23,723 players

These figures paint a grim picture for Bethesda. It took them eight years to produce a game that not only fails to surpass but barely matches the engagement of their older titles. A ""Fallout 4 - Space Edition"" or a substantial DLC would have likely been a more successful venture.

I played Starfield for a mere 8 hours, enough to confirm the myriad issues highlighted in other reviews. I refuse to waste more time on a game that has left me, a long-time Bethesda admirer, deeply disappointed, frustrated, and saddened. There's no incentive for me to invest my creativity in playing or modding Starfield.

76561198000264094,215,1716740,Starfield,"Starfield is an embarrassingly bad attempt at a game, let alone an RPG. 

The writing is dogwater, and the lore sucks. You're just handed so much crap just because you're the main character, logic be damned. The game [i]also[/i] treats you like an idiot even when your character would logically have a lot of knowledge about the world (i.e. if you have a mercenary backstory). 

The world is not believable. Am I really supposed to believe that the backwater junk town of Akila City is the capital city of a government with enough military might to glass planets? How in the hell is the pipsqueak city of New Atlantis the jewel of humanity? The dissonance between the lore and what we see on screen is astounding.

The game is rated M for Mature, but plays things so incredibly safe. It's like it's trying to appeal to kids whilst having adult themes. Neon, for example, is a joke when it comes to presenting cliche Cyberpunk themes. It just checks off boxes. Drugs? Check. Corporations that rule over everyone? Check! Doesn't matter how well executed the themes are, or how cringe everything is, as long as they're there.

The graphics are mediocre. The lighting leaves a lot to be desired. Cities like New Atlantis are barren and devoid of life. The color grading is intense and almost all of the LUTs used result in ludicrously raised black levels. Have an OLED? F*ck you, suffer.

Almost all game mechanics have no depth, and have the same exact jank we've seen in other Bethesda games for 15 years now. Some skills unlock game mechanics which should have just been available by default, like the stealth meter. 

Some game mechanics are entirely null and void because of how poorly thought out they are. As an example, the Contraband system. By the time Contraband is finally worth looting, because you've finally unlocked and invested in the skills and the equipment to dodge security scans, [i]the average weapon drop[/i] is worth nearly as much as Contraband. Just loot dozens of weapons and waste your time fast forwarding time a dozen times over when selling the weapons to refresh the vendors because the vendor system sucks, and completely ignore Contraband.

The Radiant AI used in Bethesda's previous games is downgraded. In Skyrim, at least a shopkeeper actually did stuff, like occasionally sweep the floor, or sleep. In Starfield, their only existence is being behind the counter, doing literally nothing.

The exploration is a joke; almost all planets and moons have copy pasted locales. You'll be running through the same facilities dozens of times, reading the same notes, coming across the same props and the same bits of loot arranged the exact same way every time. Do you like running? You'll be doing a lot of it. No flying above the surface, through atmosphere. No ground vehicles. Just running in a straight line for hundreds of meters at a time.

Holy loading screens, Batman. How is an open world space game THIS full of loading screens? Why do I need a loading screen to enter a store? To enter my ship? What kind of ancient world streaming system is in this game? Why does the game feel like it deliberately provokes the player to abuse fast travel?

The entire basebuilding system exists in a vacuum. Almost nothing you do in basebuilding affects any of the other game mechanics, aside from research and crafting mods, which can easily be done without touching basebuilding at all. The only thing you get from investing in basebuilding is the ability to build more and bigger bases. Woohoo, I guess.

No control of the layout of doors in the ship builder? Are you serious? This is such a basic feature that's missing, and the lack of it absolutely ruins some ship designs because you're forced to deal with an asinine flow through the ship with no way to fix it. 

The most OP DPS build is one where you cover your ship in autocannons. The most effective combat ship is literally one where you do absolutely nothing except maybe fly in a straight line. Even if you didn't use autocannons, maneuverability as a concept means almost nothing. You won't be struggling to get on target or anything unless you deliberately make a ship's maneuverability go as low as possible, and even then, combat is the only thing where it matters. No races, no atmospheric flight, nothing which requires your ship to really do anything.

Enemy variety sucks. All your ground enemies are just different flavors of human which all act in almost exactly the same way, or copypaste aliens which you're only really fighting because high level alien extinction is a great XP farm. It's the same with ships; there's no real ship classes or ship variety to really make fighting different ships feel different to one another... and it doesn't matter anyways because your OP Autocannon build will delete them from existence in a few seconds, regardless of what they are.

Do better, Bethesda.",2024-01-04 06:27:27,155203438,0,True,False
