      "['122.4 hour , I do all the major quest and most side quest in the major city . I play through twice and all in all its good . \\n\\n they could have do with 1 planet what they have do with 1000 .', 'a game that keep you think \" oh one more thing \" for several hour , be an awesome in depth game . it be that simple .', 'I rate Starfield 5.5/10 ( an ok if mediocre BGS game that have its moment , but feel like a regression in quality from previous BGS title ) . \\n\\n Starfield as an adventure / RPG be quite poor . Starfield as an FPS be fun . after I finish the bulk of quest , I be just turn my brain off and enjoy the FPS gunplay , combat in low gravity / zero - g. \\n\\n that be say , so many feature of Starfield leave you scratch your head think , \" really ? \" no brainer QOL feature from previous Bethesda title be absent , and the gameplay feature they do use in Starfield be weak / poorly think out / shoe - horn in / rush for the deadline . \\n\\n I be guess it be top - down decision make mismanagement that make Starfield feel like a regression in quality instead of play on strength find in prior Bethesda game . \\n\\n there be EM weapon , ship \\'s brig component , contraband/ smuggling system that feel like they should have have great functionality and purpose , but someone meet with the dev team for those system and say \" we get to ship this game , send it as - be . \" and so you be leave with gameplay mechanic that be TECHNICALLY there ... but be functionally worthless and do not add to the game in a meaningful way . \\n\\n that be just one example . I really think the lead developer / project manager make have 1000 procedurally generate planet the core concept of the game , which mean that the rest of the gameplay mechanic be half - bake because they spend the majority of development on have 1000 procedurally generate , uninteresting planet , rather than focus on exploration / worldbuilde / environmental storytelling , which be the STRONGEST part of previous BGS title . there be little reward for player to actually explore ! \\n\\n\\n - Starfield be a mile wide and an inch deep . \\n\\n -Story , quest & lore feel half - hearted , cut short for time and bland . \\n\\n -Bethesda create the lore for this game , and choose the most boring time to start your adventure . colony war be over ! no mechs or army with weaponized alien . \\n\\n the citizen , guard , etc .. from the 2 main faction complain about each other but they be at peace . you can complete all the quest for one faction , join the next and do all the quest , and join the space pirate and do all their quest and it do not effect the story at all ! I think BGS would have learn what game mechanic from their previous title work well that player enjoy and implement they in Starfield . I have hope we would get something like Skyrim or F : NV where there would be consequence to your choice ( gain positive reputation with a faction that put you in poor standing / lock you out from faction questline and other location under a faction ) but the game world feel anaemic and unresponsive to Player action and decision . \\n\\n  -game system that seem to have some purpose somewhere along development but be make completely redundant by full release \\n\\n  ( craft , cooking / food , smuggling contraband , shipbuilding , resource collection / mining , colony , spaceship fuel / grav jump range , stealth ) \\n\\n - more than half the skill be unnecessary , and quite a lot of grind be require to level up skil \\n\\n -Poor U.I \\n\\n -power be pointless ; I only use \" personal atmosphere \" to give myself oxygen because I be constantly over encumbered haul only resource and loot to and from my ship \\n\\n -you\\'ll spend an hour in real time try to sell 40,000 credit worth of loot to 6 different merchant who only have 5000 credit on hand ( and the trade authority vendor , who have 12,000 credit ) . sell 3 - 4 gun will give you every credit the vendor have on hand . you will have to find a bench to sit on , wait 48hrs for they to restock . and unlike previous game , a maxxe out commerce skill do not give you the option to invest a sum of credit with a vendor to increase their buying capacity . \\n\\n -Say you want to use ammo as a second currency with vendor ; you buy up all the ammo a vendor have , and sell loot to get your credit back . the U.I do not speed up the selection of the quantity of ammo / med / resource you wish to sell like previous Bethesda game , so you can hold down the left thumbstick for half an hour to sell the amount that will clear the vendor of their credit , or you can give they all of a stack of ammo / med / resource save you time , but give the surplus value away to a vendor for free . \\n\\n -i\\'d like to use the Bridger grenade launcher , except only some gun shop carry 40 mm ammo and between 3 - 25 at any time . so I spend a bunch of time sit on a bench and wait 48hrs for they to restock , buy out all the 40 mm and wait another 48hrs . Bleh \\n\\n -It feel pointless to explore planet . no matter where you land , you be always 500 m from the exact same abandon robotic lab , mining outpost , frozen research station . seriously , for a 2023 title , I know the layout of every dungeon because there be only like a dozen of they ! enemy spawn in the same place everytime , loot be find in the same place , the 3rd locker down on the left always have credstick on its shelf .. it be pathetic . Skyrim have hundred of unique dungeon within one province of Tamriel and STARFIELD with hundred of empty planet and moon only have a dozen or so dungeon that be find on every planet and moon . you will know every time where enemy spawn , where keycards spawn , where safe and contraband spawn ... \\n\\n -research base \\n -underground frozen research base \\n -mine facility with vat of lava \\n -the tall research base with the elevator \\n -abandone robotic facility ( with note on how the staff be use the robot to deliver coffee ) \\n -deeper mining facility \\n\\n -you\\'ll face either spacer , crimson fleet pirate , ecliptic mercs , or var\\'uun heretic at any of the dozen location . for all intent and purpose , they be completely the same ( behaviour in combat ) \\n\\n what s the point of a big open world if there be nothing interesting inside ? \\n\\n it feel like I buy a tall glass of juice but the waiter drink 75 % of it before water it down and give it to I for $ 90 CAD ( $ 110 after tax ) \\n\\n in conclusion , this be a step down in quality from Bethesda compare to previous title . Bethesda take the good gameplay mechanic from their previous game , remove the QOL mechanic and half assed shoe horn the other into Starfield . it feel like the game be underdeveloped , rush to completion , overhype , and absolutely disappointing for a 2023 title from a triple a game studio . \\n\\n I would wait a year or two for the game to go on sale .. it would not feel right to pay more than $ 30 for the game ( do not spend $ 90 + like I do on Starfield ! ) \\n\\n that be say , if Bethesda listen to player feedback and provide free , meaningful update I will update my review accordingly . for the time be , I be not interested in pay more for additional DLC when the base game at full price feel incomplete .', 'not look forward to TES6 anymore', 'a lot of people have rightly point out the bore planet , the dull shooting and many of the other issue with this game , but I want to point out one of the big reason this game fail to grab my imagination in the way it clearly want to ; its combination of sterile and safe storytelling with a bad habit of tell instead of show . \\n\\n in New Atlantis , the capitol village - I mean \" city \" of the United Colonies , the suppose big star nation in the setting , you see fully armored riot look cop patrol everywhere , then you go down to the Well , the admittedly neat look pseudo - undercity of New Atlantis , and see graffiti of a UC soldier execute someone with \" all hail our benevolent overlord \" write sardonically besides it . that pair with loading screen hit of ther UC have \" maybe too many law \" you would think that this be set up that the shiny , Star Trek Looking faction that have drape itself in \" Good Guy Space America \" may have a dark side , even before you find out that they be legit do United Citizen Federation shit of haivng citizenship need to be earn and necessary for own a home and other basic thing . but then something weird happen .... nothing happen , even when you find out a moderate twist during their faction mission , the UC keep be just a bunch of goody goody folk who just wanna protect civilian . all that lead up of a sinister side be just window dressing . \\n\\n I think thing would be well once I hit Neon , a City build like a massive oil platform on an ocean planet cover in hologram and neon light and supposidly riddle with crime and drug like a nautical Night City ? I could not get my spacer ass over there fast enough ! it even look great at first with the lightning strike hit the city \\'s sheild , the guard make sure that nobody smuggle out the dangerously addictive drug that be legal inside the city , all the way to the smokey cyberpunk / nautical town look street . but just like New Atlantis and the UC , all this talk of Neon be a dangerous and risky place with crime and corruption all over be just that , a bunch of talk as the place end up quickly feel more like a suburban strip mall with bad weather and some corporate brand graffiti to try and look \\' street \\' . \\n\\n after finish a questline for the most friendly and well behave gang ever I set course for the Freestar collective , maybe some space weastern , Serenety style feel would finally immerse I in this game I pay eeventy real life dollar for . Akila City be less offensive in it be break promise than the previous city , it sure do feel and look like a sort of Star Wars / Serenity space weastern pastiche and even have a old timey bank robbery go on . but like the rest , all the talk of the super dangerous wildlife constantly at the wall like they be on a death world go unfulfilled in any meaningful way . \\n\\n the rest of the game feel the same , sterile and safe , pirate who talk cringingly about how they be go to totally betray you and oh you well not cross they sonny jim but come accross like teenager from a gate community try to act hard . sterile and constantly touch on theme and idea that it later forget , Starfield could not make an immersive world if it try , and that s why after play through the entire damn thing the most fun I find be help a clone of Gengis Khan stage a prison break against a clone of FDR and an egyptian queen because at least that be bafflingly amusing . seriously if you want a fun space RPG , go play the outer world , it take you about 30 hour maybe to finish everything but damn if it do not make I legit feel like a han solo type . \\n\\n like the idea of make your own spaceship though , shame about the bloody ladder', \"no Man 's Skyrim\", 'some point after the 30th \" Collapsed mine \" with the exact same layout , with the exact same corpse placement with the exact same note on they it just get old .', 'I want to wait until I finish the story to review this game , I really do , but I just can not bring myself to play it anymore , so here we be . the Starfield review . warning : there will be very minor spoiler ! \\n\\n in short : a barren wasteland paint with a layer of gold . \\n\\n when I first launch this game , I be ecstatic . I could not wait to delve into the world(s ) of Starfield . the opening visual take my breath away , I love the customization , I love how real everything look , I just fall in love , and that be all before even board the first ship . I be in awe when I first enter it , slowly go over and admire all the little detail and quirk . it do not just look like a mode of transportation , it look like somebody home . it look live in . I make my way to the cockpit , and while I do not know it at the time , this would be the first dent in Starfield \\'s armor . I navigate my way to Kreet . the navigation have its charm at first but as I get far into the game , it go from a charming afterthought to an actual annoyance just to travel from planet to planet ( I find the label \" fast travel simulator \" accurate ) . I land on Kreet and make my way inside the research station . I do not know it but once again , this be another dent in the armor of Starfield that would come into play later . I clear the base , complete the objective , make my way to New Atlantis and the real gameplay truly begin . \\n\\n I be still in love with the game . so excited to do quest , fight enemy , customize my own ship , all of that . I be ecstatic . what first begin to wear on I be the space travel and travel between planet . as I say early , it go from a charm to a dreaded annoyance . be it the bad thing ever ? absolutely not , but neither be it anything remotely innovative or entertaining . it be a literal chore . what next begin to take a toll on I be the planet and their layout and terrain . they be by no means bad , but just come off as generic . you go from place to place to place and eventually realize all that be change be the weather and gravity . at this point I still like the game but be start to see some flaw . then come the generic enemy . there be really no easy way to put it , you go literally anywhere in the galaxy and you be either fight A ) Spacers , B ) pirate or C ) other . that be it . there be almost no variation whatsoever . next be some bug . to be clear , I do not encounter nearly as many bug as some other have , but I have my fair share . NPC \\'s glitching through floor and wall , item float in mid air or just not load in at all , the usual from Bethesda . Next be the quest . there be some decent one that I enjoy do but for the most part , it be just classic Bethesda : go kill this enemy , go fetch this item , go tell this person something , come back and get your money . also , the story , as I experience so far at least , be less than ideal . I would not say it be bad , but I be a big fan of story game and whatever the plot of this game be , it be not it . \\n\\n at this point I be no long view the game through rise colored glass , the honeymoon have wear off but I still have hope ... until the big issue I encounter arose . the most prominent be how planet and enemy outpost and whatnot generate . on paper , it sound really cool : over 1,000 planet , many of they procedurally generate . that should allow a ton of variation and uniqueness , right ? well , like I say , on paper , yes . but in practice , it be some of the most lazy game design there be . like many thing in Starfield , it seem cool at first but the interest and joy quickly fade the more planet you visit and the more you realize it be basically all the same . you will encounter the same basis , the same landmark , the same everything , which lead I into what kill the game for I : copy and paste base layout . remember when I go to Kreet early and do that mission ? well that first base leave an impression on I because well , obviously it be the first base you find . well hour later , I come across another base on a separate moon ... with the exact same layout . and when I say exact same , I mean exact same , down to dead NPC \\'s , item placement , in some situation loot , everything . at first I think , \" hey , it be a massive game . surely I be go to encounter a little copy and paste , that be ok \" . and it be ok ... the first time . and then it happen again . and again . and again . and again . and again . there be only a few base variation and they would simply copy and paste over to their procedurally generate area and that be where the real dagger happen . the pinpointed moment where I realize what I be play . I be on some moon , do not even remember the name ( do it matter ? they be all the same ) , do a mission . I finish clear a small base when I see a marker on the map for a cave like 800 meter away . figure what the hell , I have get time and inventory space , let us go clear out this cave . it be a base in the side of a mountain , if you have any meaningful amount of time in the game , you will know exactly the type of base layout I mean : equipment and stuff outside , a guard or two keeping watch and when you enter the cave , there be a tunnel lead to a big cavern with enemy which in turn lead to an even large cavern with an inoperable elevator and more enemy . I have see this layout 5 or 6 time now but whatever . cleared it out , grab my loot and go back outside . I see another marker on my map 300 meter away , figure I would go check that one out too . I make my way over to the other side of this mountain and what do I see ? the same exact base , copy and paste 300 meter away . same enemy , same enemy layout , same item and loot , same everything . it be literally the exact same . and that be it . that be the moment the curtain fall and I realize what I be get into . \\n\\n it be all a big smoke and mirror show . an illusion . that be really all I can describe it as . say what you will about Skyrim or Fallout 4 ( and trust I , there be plenty to criticize ) but at least each building , each interior , each cave be handcraft , not this regurgitated drivel . there be no life to it , no soul , no personality . it be like if you tell an AI to make an infinite space science fiction rpg for the masse . and to be clear , that be who Starfield be for : the masse . same with the early mention Skyrim and Fallout 4 , Bethesda be no long make challenging game with interesting dialogue and compelling story . it be all water down , streamlined , easily consumable slop for the masse and Starfield be the epitome of that . \\n\\n all that being say , I would like to highlight some positive . while there be not many , I would feel remiss not mention they . firstly for I be the graphic . while they be by no mean out of this world ( pun slightly intended ) , they still look fantastic . there be also atmosphere . as I say early with ship , they do not just look like mode of transportation . while it be all mostly eye candy , the amount of detail that go into just the small , minute thing be what really get I . I do also enjoy the combat and gunplay . while gun still have that Bethesda feel to they , they still work well and there be a wide variety to choose from . there be also a ton of customization . if there be a singular positive thing about the game I would like to highlight , it be ship customization . grant , while a large portion of it be purely cosmetic and will not impact gameplay , the ship customization be fantastic . \\n\\n in its present state , I would give Starfield a 3/10 and could not in good conscience recommend it to anyone . it be a shell of what be promise and honestly keep I in fear of what the eld Scrolls 6 will be like and I hope Bethesda learn from this and take step to remedy it in future game . I can only hope it receive similar quality of life update to no Man \\'s Sky and Cyberpunk and be bring back from the brink . however , consider how Bethesda react to criticism , I be not hold my breath though .', \"ok this be tough . you know how chocolate chip cookie taste good even when under - baked ? this game be like that . I think I look so forward to play it I have be look at it with affection like I would a little brother with developmental delay . it be heart be solid , and I have a lot of love for the idea in it , but the gameplay and mechanic be barely conceive . it be like the game creator at Bethesda be live in a vacuum and have not play any game for the past ten year . they be struggle to keep up in the race while I shout for they to run , run ! RUN ! I so want they to get a prize . this hope bring I almost 200 hour in . \\n\\n why be not there a sweet buggy to survey planet with ? why do I have to tediously on foot survey planet surface for resource when a special binocular from a mountain top would reveal what I need for an outpost ? this be the future ! I be out here like the Louis and Clark expedition . why be outpost so clunky and janky ? the QOL here be nonexistent . it be like have a game where you do your taxis or something . \\n\\n why be the narrative so simplified ? why be character like card - board cutout ? they say the same insipid thing over and over . [ spoiler ] and why be the Starborn fighting each other when they could gather the artifact , all get on one ship with an armillary on it and go through Unity together ? surely some ancient starborn character could get the young NG3 upstart in line . [ /spoiler ] why do the city that be 200 year old feel like set piece at six flag ? why be the game world lifeless and broken and barely passable at what it be portray ? NPCS stare lifelessly at wall ... there be countless question in my mind as to why , how , wtf ? so much just be not well think through , underdeveloped , barely passable , lack evolution , adaptation or innovation . I could go on but everyone have hear the critique . \\n\\n again , QOL be not even on the game 's radar . an awkward , ultimately sad , outdated game , empty and ponderous , uphold by the hope of its fan ( I ) , play out of obligation and a kind of nostalgic hope . mod will improve it as many have say , but it take a real hero to slog through this game ten time ( NG+ , I make it to NG2 before throw in the towel ) . sadly , I be not that hero . \\n\\n I realize tonight I play this much in the hope it would somehow fulfill the desire I truly have for a game that will set the bar high ( even if just in Bethesda Land ) , instead of receive another special need bus . I can no long make the excuse to myself I have be make . I will reinstall in a couple year and see what the modder have create to re - imagine and refine . I love my brother , but there be a whole world of well - form game out there to discover . perhaps that be what the Bethesda creator could have contemplate when develop a game about exploration and the limitless possibility of the human experience in an infinite multiverse .\", 'at first it be mind numbingly boring , then for a few hour it pick up and wow you will never do everything this game have to offer , then a few more hour later you realize you have do everything this game have to offer and all the point of interest be copy paste . \\n\\n how be everything a direct downgrade from Skyrim and Fallout 4 ? very disappointing , Bethesda . very much so not worth $ 70 .', \"a little back - story first : Morrowind be one of the first game I have ever instal on my first ever pc … my first RPG , my first open - world game and my first all - nighter … with so many first of my gaming life , it be also love at first sight . so I can confidently say that Bethesda game hold a special place in my heart and to be honest , with such high affection also come high expectation \\n\\n compare to previous Bethesda title , general stability of the game be much well . no game - break bug , almost no crash ( I have 3 crash in 100 hour which be fair enough ) , mostly NPC / Companion related camera angle bug which be part of the experience at this point to be honest but let ’s be real ; this level of polish be only make possible with the resource of Microsoft not Bethesda . if not for the acquisition ( which be the well possible scenario for Bethesda in my opinion ) , this game would be riddle with catastrophic bug . so when it come to polish , Microsoft definitely save the day . \\n\\n my big gripe with this game and in general with Bethesda be the Creation Engine . yes , the game use creation Engine 2 but still , it ’ the same base code since Morrowind and it show … it definitely show . have an ssd be a must if you want to play this game , it ’ not optional . technically you can play it on an hdd but you will lose your mind . loading screen be everywhere … I can understand different instance with fairly large interior but small shop , house etc . all be instance with load screen . during one of the quest , I enter a room which be probably 2 meter by 3 meter , I spend 20 second in there and it be load screen enter and loading screen exiting … why Bethesda … why ? \\n\\n Creation Engine definitely do not meet the requirement of a modern open world game . it feel extremely bloated and it show . performance be all around the place ; with ultra - setting I have 60 fps in tax location yes but I have a 4080 … this be not a card that you settle with 60 fps … and if it ’ like this in the high end , I do not want to know what it ’ like in the low end . btw , Elder Scrolls VI be also be develop with Creation Engine 2 so I have a lot of reservation about it at this point … creation Engine need to go Bethesda , enough be enough . \\n\\n I start talk about the shortcoming of the game on purpose because almost all the negative part of the game can be link to the inadequacy of the game engine ; facial expression of character for example , much well compare to previous game yes but just a month before a [ i]tiny , little[/i ] game call [ b]baldur ’s Gate 3[/b ] come into our life and compare the two [ i](yes , I know … two game be fundamentally different but still … both be rpg and both be AAA game , so a comparison be warranted)[/i ] , BG3 stand head and shoulder above Starfield . the disappointment on Wyll ’s face when I refuse his romantic advancement , the emotion of Minsc when he ’s talk about Boo … these have stay with I long after ... in Starfield , I can recall no such memory … I romance Sarah in my initial play - through and it be … .meh … not bad but ... not memorable either . BG3 give that emotion with every single character ... the [ i]“feeling”[/i ] Larian Studios manage to give I … I want that Bethesda … and it ’s not happen with the Creation Engine … again … enough be enough … creation Engine need to go ! \\n\\n Alright … now that ’ out of the way , let ’s talk about why this game deserve every single penny you spend … yes , I know … after all I ’ve say about the awful game engine , how this game can be worth any money … \\n\\n love it or hate it … they make it work … it ’ still a Bethesda RPG through and through . \\n\\n do not get I wrong ; like this game require a specific mindset so it ’ definitely not for everybody … but if you do have that specific mindset ... you will have fun with this game for the foreseeable future . \\n\\n first of all , main campaign be really good . it ask really fundamental question about existence ... and for answer … let ’s just say , you have to make your own deduction … nothing more , nothing less … \\n\\n side quest be also satisfactory . faction quest be very memorable experience and other small side quest definitely do not feel forced . I truly believe they be all hand craft . randomly generate quest be a plenty but the point you get they be fair and obvious so you do not feel cheat . \\n\\n graphic be good….ye the engine be old and outdated , performance be want but damn you can take some seriously cool screenshot in this game . \\n\\n ship and outpost building : this be Lego … no question about it … during any part of your childhood , if you have come across Lego and fall in love with it , this game be ' digital Lego ' . since Fallout 4 , it ’ probably the good gameplay mechanic Bethesda have come up with . I do not care about the bug , I do not care about anything else … I can build my own dream starship and planetary outpost … I can build a commercial empire throughout the settle system … it might take year but I can … \\n\\n for a game … any game … replayability / gameplay loop be king and it be here , which bring I to another main point : MODS . \\n\\n Modding have always be a major part of Bethesda game . I ’m go a step far … modding be the reason Bethesda be Bethesda today … without the modding community , this company would not have become the titan it be today , so let ’s give the credit where it ’ due : silent protagonist of the Bethesda story – Modders … \\n\\n the main game have its flaw , yes … but even if it do not , modder will be modder and do their own thing … this game will be officially and unofficially update for the foreseeable future … until Elder Scrolls VI come , this be it … it ’ your digital Lego for the next decade . \\n\\n above , I say Starfield require a specific mindset and this be what I mean … to love this game , you need to be a bit old school … try to fix thing manually , try to change thing manually … accept that thing be not give with update but take through research . \\n\\n think about it … all my gripe with the game engine etc . … maybe it ’ intentional … maybe … just maybe it ’ part of the design … to push we brave through the starfield … to be bear among the star … one more time … \\n\", 'Starfield make Fallout 4 look like a masterpiece .', 'I be torn . \\n\\n this game be right up my alley . I love space . I love sci - fi . I love the traditional Bethesda nonsense . I love the potential of procedural generation . I should absolutely love this game . \\n\\n and I do love a lot of thing about it . I love the style . NASA - punk be a perfect description and man it work . the sound design be fantastic . the gun - play be solid . it be not mil - sim level , which I think would have be a vast improvement over the bullet - sponge RPG hybrid shooter we have get now , but it be functional . \\n\\n I love the realistic planet and moon . I love how realistically barren they be . I love that the game tell I the temperature and atmospheric pressure and gravity and I love that it all make sense . small moon with very low gravity and no magnetosphere ? no atmosphere for you . no atmosphere , no life . some might call that excessively dry and slavish adherence to science , but I super dig that . \\n\\n I love that the game use real element as resource , rather than make up nonsense . I like that it combine they in fairly reasonable way for craft . \\n\\n I love craft , while we be on the subject . I think the ability to personalize a weapon to do exactly the job you want add a lot to the game . \\n\\n but it stumble in a few perplexing way . \\n\\n 1 . People have complain in the past about a world that level with you and it seem like Bethesda have take that feedback to heart . as a result , you will quickly level out of large portion of the game . enemy will be no challenge and the loot they drop of no interest . I can not imagine that the fleeting satisfaction of stomp low - level enemy be worth lose significant portion of the game world as viable content , but that seem to be the deal that be make here . \\n\\n 2 . it be a bit of a fast - travel simulator . I do not really have any expectation for how this game would handle space and travel , so it would not be fair to say that I be disappointed . More that I see it as a miss opportunity . I have no doubt that the current system be the result of technical limitation , but that do not make it good . and it be not good . the complaint you see about the travel system be legit . it be pretty bad and it negatively impact the entire experience . \\n\\n 3 . it be not as realistic as it seem like it want to be . it be realistic enough to be irritate . you have significant limit on what you can carry , for example . it be not realistic enough to be immersive , though . when you wear a space suit , you never [ i]feel[/i ] like you be wear a space suit . you do not get a helmet overlay that fog up and cast reflection . you can not hear the sound of your own breathing . you move around completely unencumbered . maybe I be just a weirdo , but that pull I right out of it . \\n\\n 4 . the story and character be not interesting . the writing be puerile . the character be one - note and completely lack depth . the world itself be immensely violent , but in the most PG way . Set next to something like the witcher game or Cyberpunk , it be kind of startling how bad Starfield be in this department . \\n\\n _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ \\n\\n at one point , I be serve as a member of law enforcement . it arise that I must apprehend a person of interest in an investigation . the game have already provide to I a weapon that incapacitate enemy . I equip such a weapon since I be law enforcement and attempt to apprehend this person of interest . \\n\\n it turn out that the game do not account for the idea that someone serve as law enforcement would want to apprehend a suspect criminal . after incapacitate the individual in question and their retinue of bodyguard , I literally could not proceed with the quest until I walk around and put a bullet in each of their brain . \\n\\n maybe it just do not occur to the developer that police arrest people . maybe the technical implementation of arrest people and haul they back to your ship be see as too much work for no real payoff . but that sequence really tip I from \" yeah , this be alright \" to \" Jesus what be I even play \" \\n\\n this be not really a recommendation for Starfield . I be enjoy it enough to keep play and I suspect mod will address all ( or most ) of these concern . but that will be a year or more down the line . as it stand now , I can not really recommend it without some serious caveat . \\n\\n also it run like absolute dog shit . I be on a 3090 and regularly get ~45 FPS in city . \\n\\n Christ this be a long review . sorry .', 'the good part of Skyrim and Fallout4 but in space . if you like Bethesda rpg and space odyssey then you will like Starfield . \\n Disclaimer : this be not no Mans Sky 2 , it be not try to be NMS2 , do not expect NMS2 .', 'we have be hear for year that Starfield be Bethesda \\'s passion project , a game that they have be want to make even before Morrowind come out . \\n\\n if this game be Bethesda \\'s passion project , then they have lose their passion . \\n\\n Plenty of reviewer be drag Starfield for its technical issue . while it be true that Bethesda should not get a free pass on that stuff just because \" lol , they be Bethesda \" , I be prepared to accept a certain level of jank if it mean experience an inspired world . what really kill this game be that the set itself be deeply , relentlessly boring . it be a haphazard collage of space frontier trope . and you know what ? that could have be fine . trope can be effective when wield in service of a strong creative vision . but here , there be no great vision . there be nothing , and I mean * nothing * , to this setting beyond the trope that serve as its foundation . \\n\\n for our major power , we have a vaguely western - flavor federal government , a vaguely Texan - flavor frontier alliance , a vaguely eastern - flavor corpocracy , some scrappy pirate , and some mysterious religious zealot . there be nothing meaningful to know about any of these society beyond whatever picture of they you just conjure in your head . if you have an ounce of creativity , the picture in your head be probably more detailed and compelling than the crap that make it into the game . it almost seem like these faction have be consciously sanitize , as if someone go through the first draft and remove any cultural or aesthetic identifier beyond the baseline of \" hey , this frontier guy wear a cowboy hat , like gun , and have a bit of a stubborn streak ! \" . you would think that the writer would be force to come up with some creative quirk just to explain how these people adapt to their alien environment , but even that minimal level of flavor exceed the bound of Bethesda \\'s vision . \\n\\n this aggressive blandness persist at every scale . we have planet that run the gamut of environmental condition , but none of they impose meaningful gameplay change ( aside from gravity \\'s effect on jump height , which be basically the low hang fruit possible ) , inspire variation on the ten or so prefabricate structure that we can encounter , or even have much influence on which of the handful of flora , fauna , and feature asset can populate the game \\'s tragically samey landscape . one of the foundational aspect of space exploration as a genre be explore how extreme condition shape strategy and society . Starfield care so little for this relationship that it border on immersion - breaking . I expect that Starfield would rely on repeatable asset to some extent , and that exploration would lose its shine once you have exhaust the list of thing to encounter . what I do not expect be just how short that list would be , or how sloppily curate it would be in the context of the game \\'s environment . \\n\\n and then there be the writing . oh goodness , the writing . the good thing I can say be that , on a micro scale , it consist of grammatically correct sentence which could plausibly be utter by a sane human being . beyond that , it be shoot through with the same listlessness that permeate every other aspect of the game . I will present two case study . \\n\\n I come upon a sidequ where an unknown vessel be orbit a resort planet . investigation reveal it to be a generation ship send from Old Earth , back before humanity develop FTL travel . they do not take it well when you explain that their new home have already be claim by Space Epcot . the captain ask you , some random hobo who just happen across they , to negotiate with the corpos on their behalf . they send along no observer or advocate , and do not even think to request a direct line of communication . the corpos offer you three option : blow up the ship and kill the colonist , coerce they into indentured servitude , or pay out of your own pocket to install an ftl drive aboard their ship so they can find another planet . there be no other option to advocate for the colonist . at no point do either party express any sort of cultural interest , or even basic curiosity about the other . there be no potential interaction with other faction or alternate arrangement for compensation , despite it be well - establish that everything to do with Old Earth ( down to the mean paperweight ) be treat as an invaluable piece of vintage history . the situation have the setup for a potentially game - change historical event , and the most interesting thing Bethesda can squeeze from it be \" Corpos bad , be you willing to pay to feel well than they ? \" if a 15th century carrack make landfall on the shore of Florida carry the long lose descendent of Ferdinand Magellan \\'s twin brother , I do not think Disney World \\'s first reaction would be \" Shit , they want our land , pump them full of lead ! \" \\n\\n Second case study . there be a plotline where you infiltrate the big pirate faction on behalf of the feds , right under the nose of their cunning leader and his paranoid , security - obsess XO . so how do you stay in contact with your handler during this delicate deep cover op ? by PHYSICALLY fly from the PIRATE BASE to the federal FLAGSHIP every time you complete a mission . Holy hell , be dead drop not a thing in this universe ? be the feds actively try to give you away ? during these OpSec - destroy excursion , you will have the opportunity to turn in supplementary evidence on the pirate \\' many crime . this evidence come in the form of incriminate tape that be just lay around in the general vicinity of the perpetrator . none of they , include the canny , wary pirate leader , will raise objection to you stuff say tape into your knapsack in full view of everyone . while turn in these tape , you will speak to the federal XO , who repeatedly inquire as to your impression of the pirate leader . you can either lie and say he be a nosepicke vagrant , in which case you will be praise for your patriotism , or you can accurately inform she that he be an intelligent and charismatic figure who pose a real threat , in which case she will chew you out for the betrayal of respect the enemy . the questline sustain this level of cartoonishness right up to the end , where the defeat , betray pirate leader tell your narc ass that he be proud of you because deep down , you be the great pirate of all . a generous reading could paint this horrorshow as a satire of Hoover \\'s CIA or something , but I be not feel very generous at the moment . \\n\\n the common thread between these two case be apathy . these scenario have the potential to be so interesting and memorable , and the writer probably have the chop to deliver . but instead , they just ... settle for mediocrity . they be write with the expectation that they will not be hold to a high standard . situation do not have to make sense , commentary do not need to be thoughtful , narrative potential do not yearn to be realize . Dialogue be just there to point the way towards more gameplay , so write a few word and move on to the next contrivance . More and more , I feel like Bethesda view their game as theme park ; they be not write a story , they be build a bunch of ride and do the minimum necessary to shuffle people from one to the other . \\n\\n and now , the ride be not even fun . Starfield use humdrum , recycled asset to simulate a humdrum , recycle setting . none of its component do anything to support each other : not the worldbuilding , not the environment , not the gameplay , not the writing . every part of this game talk past every other part , and if you care to listen , you will find that they be all just ramble drunkenly about the weather . the result be a joyless , colorless mess memorable only for the length it go to insult its player . Bethesda can do well than this . but they probably will not , because they do not think they have to , and apparently professional shame be not enough of a motivator for they .', 'spread my seed across galaxy , ensure the survival of the bloodline of John Starfield , with a little corporate espionage on the side . Godd Howard for sure do it again , 16x the detail this time . npc do be stare deeply into your soul though .', \"Starfield be a good game , not a great game , certainly not Bethesda 's good product . it be pretty much fallout in space . there be a few game design feature that make it look like no Man 's Sky , but it really play nothing like NMS and honestly make I appreciate NMS that much more since a huge organization like Bethesda could not just copycat what Hello Games have accomplish . \\n\\n Starfield be all about quest line and NPC interaction . there be a few different quest line and they be all well do with great voice act as can be expect from Bethesda . beyond that , nothing else really stand out as be amazing . \\n\\n there be many downside : \\n\\n 1 ) the minimum system requirement be insane . I be able to run it at mostly 30 fps on my dinosaur computer from 2012 by download a mod to reduce the texture size . I really do not feel like this game need 2 k texture which effectively require player to have a serious gaming rig to play this without mod . ~$2,000 for their recommend rig . \\n 2 ) the menu system be not user friendly . to be frank , it be downright horrible . it take I 25ish hour to finally learn how to maneuver in an out of the menu efficiently . I almost just stop play at around the 15 hour mark because the menu be so painfully un intuitive . \\n 3 ) too much fast travel . there be actually very little need to use your starship in this game . and even if you do want to fly your ship , it be not even possible in the normal sense of fly from point a to point B. \\n 4 ) too many loading screen due to the previous ' too much fast travel ' issue . now grant I have a dinosaur computer and the loading time get exaggerate as a result so this be certainly less painful the well system you play on . \\n 5 ) no option for exclusive fullscreen . really Bethesda ? \\n 6 ) too many useless character skill / trait . a lot of the skill be useless due to the next bullet point . \\n 7 ) craft be unnecessary , shipbuilding be unnecessary , outpost be unnecessary .   hell I can even make an argument that the majority of player power be useless . there be obviously a lot of energy and effort put into these game feature that genuinely serve no useful utility in play the main meat of the game ( quest line ) . \\n 8) Stealth be laughable . no improvement have be make to stealth gameplay from any of their previous title . \\n\\n do I have fun with the game ? yes . would I recommend it ? if you enjoy the Fallout title , yes . overall though , I feel like it be a step backward for the franchise .\", 'my friend and I have a separate channel in our Discord server where we rant about problem with the game . we do so multiple time a week . \\n\\n when I first jump into this game , I be amazed . so much to do and so much to explore ! it feel great . like I be on the cusp of some fantastic new adventure . \\n\\n but it do not last - you know this be come . from the outside and when you just dip your finger in , it certainly look like there be a lot to Starfield , but you eventually realise that there really be not . a mile wide and an inch deep encapsulate this game perfectly . \\n\\n there be good thing about Starfield , make no mistake . but nearly without fail , it be stunt by the bad thing and prevent from actually be great . let us look at an example : shipbuilding in this game be really fun . you can look at what so many player have manage to create . that be where it end , though , because as with many other thing here - there be nothing to it . your ship be basically a glorify fast travel terminal . \\n\\n there be also outpost building . it seem really cool , you know , go out there into the vast unknown and build your own little slice of home there . but , again , there be nothing to it . once you build your first one just to see how cool it be , you quickly realise that there be not really any more of a point to do so . \\n\\n that bring I nicely to exploration . who the hell at Bethesda play this and think \" hey , it will be fun ! \" because it be not . you can not land wherever you want on the planet as you can in , say , no Man \\'s Sky . you have to point at where you want on the map , and then through a few loading screen , you finally arrive into your allotted fishbowl . I call it a fishbowl because that be precisely what it be , and it be not a particularly interesting one either . you slow jog around for a while to see the usual point of interest that be replicate on every other planet in the game , no matter its character , from supposedly civilised and settled one , all the way to the one which be suppose to be more \\' undiscovered \\' . no matter what , you will find all the same thing . it be especially puzzle when it come to the temple in game - a temple that have supposedly be undiscovered for century by human be only a few hundred metre away from a human settlement of some form . it simply make no sense . then after slow jog around this fishbowl , you will be hit with an invisible wall . oh , and do I mention that it have no land vehicle of any sort ? what the hell be a space exploration game without a space buggy ? I also do not think I need to mention that it be unacceptable to have so many loading screen from a game release in 2023 . \\n\\n I can not begin to state how much of a well design decision it would have be for Starfield to have only a few planet that be handcraft without invisible wall or random generation , or at least , that keep to a minimum . but they sell that away for the \" 1,000 planet \" marketing gimmick . beautiful handcraft world be the bread and butter of Bethesda \\'s game . it be why we love they and more importantly , why we put up with the bug and the other misgiving . without that , what do the game have ? nothing . and that be where we be at with Starfield . \\n\\n in general , I feel that Bethesda may have just lose it . other game company have put out far superior title with feature that be well than in Starfield , or they be actually present in the first place . it be like they be sit on a sugar high from the Skyrim day ( and even then , the game have actually go backwards in several respect ) . they need to wake up and move on , because everyone else have . they also talk about how this game be their \\' passion project \\' that they have want to make since Morrowind . if this be their passion project , you should be very , very concerned about what come next .', \"Starfield be an embarrassingly bad attempt at a game , let alone an RPG . \\n\\n the writing be dogwater , and the lore suck . you be just hand so much crap just because you be the main character , logic be damn . the game [ i]also[/i ] treat you like an idiot even when your character would logically have a lot of knowledge about the world ( i.e. if you have a mercenary backstory ) . \\n\\n the world be not believable . be I really suppose to believe that the backwater junk town of Akila City be the capital city of a government with enough military might to glass planet ? how in the hell be the pipsqueak city of New Atlantis the jewel of humanity ? the dissonance between the lore and what we see on screen be astounding . \\n\\n the game be rate M for Mature , but play thing so incredibly safe . it be like it be try to appeal to kid whilst have adult theme . Neon , for example , be a joke when it come to present cliche cyberpunk theme . it just check off box . drug ? check . corporation that rule over everyone ? check ! do not matter how well execute the theme be , or how cringe everything be , as long as they be there . \\n\\n the graphic be mediocre . the lighting leave a lot to be desire . city like New Atlantis be barren and devoid of life . the color grading be intense and almost all of the LUTs use result in ludicrously raise black level . have an oled ? F*ck you , suffer . \\n\\n almost all game mechanic have no depth , and have the same exact jank we have see in other Bethesda game for 15 year now . some skill unlock game mechanic which should have just be available by default , like the stealth meter . \\n\\n some game mechanic be entirely null and void because of how poorly think out they be . as an example , the Contraband system . by the time Contraband be finally worth loot , because you have finally unlocked and invest in the skill and the equipment to dodge security scan , [ i]the average weapon drop[/i ] be worth nearly as much as Contraband . just loot dozen of weapon and waste your time fast forwarding time a dozen time over when sell the weapon to refresh the vendor because the vendor system suck , and completely ignore Contraband . \\n\\n the Radiant AI use in Bethesda 's previous game be downgrade . in Skyrim , at least a shopkeeper actually do stuff , like occasionally sweep the floor , or sleep . in Starfield , their only existence be be behind the counter , do literally nothing . \\n\\n the exploration be a joke ; almost all planet and moon have copy pasted locale . you will be run through the same facility dozen of time , read the same note , come across the same prop and the same bit of loot arrange the exact same way every time . do you like run ? you will be do a lot of it . no flying above the surface , through atmosphere . no ground vehicle . just run in a straight line for hundred of meter at a time . \\n\\n Holy loading screen , Batman . how be an open world space game this full of loading screen ? why do I need a loading screen to enter a store ? to enter my ship ? what kind of ancient world streaming system be in this game ? why do the game feel like it deliberately provoke the player to abuse fast travel ? \\n\\n the entire basebuilding system exist in a vacuum . almost nothing you do in basebuilding affect any of the other game mechanic , aside from research and craft mod , which can easily be do without touch basebuilde at all . the only thing you get from invest in basebuilde be the ability to build more and big basis . Woohoo , I guess . \\n\\n no control of the layout of door in the ship builder ? be you serious ? this be such a basic feature that be miss , and the lack of it absolutely ruin some ship design because you be force to deal with an asinine flow through the ship with no way to fix it . \\n\\n the most op dps build be one where you cover your ship in autocannon . the most effective combat ship be literally one where you do absolutely nothing except maybe fly in a straight line . even if you do not use autocannon , maneuverability as a concept mean almost nothing . you will not be struggle to get on target or anything unless you deliberately make a ship 's maneuverability go as low as possible , and even then , combat be the only thing where it matter . no race , no atmospheric flight , nothing which require your ship to really do anything . \\n\\n Enemy variety suck . all your ground enemy be just different flavor of human which all act in almost exactly the same way , or copypaste alien which you be only really fight because high level alien extinction be a great XP farm . it be the same with ship ; there be no real ship class or ship variety to really make fight different ship feel different to one another ... and it do not matter anyways because your op Autocannon build will delete they from existence in a few second , regardless of what they be . \\n\\n do well , Bethesda .\", '[ h1]space be the backdrop , not the playground[/h1 ] \\n with a title like that , you be probably expect I to say Starfield be disappointing . this could not be far from my true feeling about the game . \\n\\n to put it bluntly , Starfield \\'s space travel be inferior to no Man \\'s Sky or Elite : dangerous . if you be look for a game where you can live in your ship and chill with your crew as you drift towards your next destination , Starfield will not fulfill your dream . space be simply use as the backdrop for something much big than Bethesda have ever do before . that be not to say space travel be not important . it be very important ! but most of the time , space be use as a means of get from one planet to another via fast travel / warping . \\n\\n [ b]space be just a loading screen ... or be it?[/b ] \\n you might ask \" do anything happen in space , since it be just a loading screen ? \" the answer be actually yes ! very often ! during warps , the game will run a check of your route to see if you would run into any random event . if so , you will be send out of the loading screen and back into space . you can interact with the random event , or simply begin fast travel again . in my opinion , this simply cut out all the slow moment of space travel and highlight the fun part . although , there be a catch . to trigger the route check , you will have to already be in space . make sure to take off in your ship whenever you want to fast travel . in the case you forget to do so , random event can still happen but only at the destination of your warp . \\n\\n the vastness of space and the insane number and variety of planet be the main attraction of Starfield . if you be familiar with Bethesda game , walk and talk be a large majority of your time . this be no different in Starfield , as you explore hundred of unique location ( not even count thousand of procedurally generate ) , and meet all kind of friendly , not - so - friendly , lunatic , suspicious , and funny character along your journey . \\n\\n [ b]rpg be back , but different[/b ] \\n Starfield be a game that arguably outshine previous Bethesda title . the scale be large , with no sacrifice to the mechanic they have have in the past . in Fallout 4 , Bethesda simplify decision - making and the RPG element in favor of improve the gunplay which leave the game feel more like an adventure - shooter than an RPG . even Skyrim could be argue , with the removal of level stat , reduce how much you could create your perfect character to roleplay as . in Starfield , stat / attribute do not come back . but in its place be an interesting return to the RPG root . \\n\\n while you do not have stat or attribute in Starfield ( such as Strength , Intelligence , Luck , etc ) , it present a different way to represent and express the kind of person you want to play as . your background , choose trait , level skill , and faction you have join properly and consistently take control of almost every situation the game put you in . \\n\\n skill be another new alternative to stat . new dialogue option will be available base on what skill you choose to level . sometimes you need to let someone know you be sneaki than other people , or that you have experience in cyber security . People can even recognize if you be a well - train pilot or gunman . \\n\\n [ b]who you be matters[/b ] \\n in the beginning , I think this be a mere farce- an illusion . perhaps they simply place many opportunity early on , to show off roleplay element , to trick I . there be no way I would be able to use my background as a Space Scoundrel or my allegiance with the Crimson Fleet for more than just a couple dialogue option , right ? \\n\\n after complete three major questline , dozen of side quest , and the main story quest , I have invest more 50 hour into Starfield over four days- an average of 12.5 hour every day . with confidence , I can report that the choice I make at character selection as well as the choice I have make during the game : who I ally with during a side quest , the faction I have decide to pledge allegiance to , the people I have kill or the people I do not kill . all of these thing feel like they matter in countless dialogue choice . I be never worry that the character I build do not matter- the opportunity jump at I constantly . many time I even have to choose between the different thing that define my character in the same interaction . \\n\\n one moment that really impress I be that faction be actually consistent in Starfield . in previous Bethesda game , join a hostile faction do not always guarantee your safety against its member . some use excuse such as \" we may be the same faction , but all of we follow different rule . \" it be a sad attempt at pass their programming ( or lack thereof ) for normally hostile npc recognize the player as an ally . in Starfield , this be not the case . \\n\\n minor spoiler in this paragraph . on my first playthrough , I join the Crimson Fleet , the most notorious pirate crew among the star . in an early mission during the main story , I have to rescue a friend from the Crimson Fleet . I enter their lair where they be hold the hostage , ready to enter a shoot - out . to my extreme but pleasant surprise , none of the pirate shoot at I . I could walk up and even begin conversation with some of they . they recognize I as one of their own , and do not blink an eye at either I or my companion . I be able to reach the bottom of the lair without any conflict , and the game even properly acknowledge it . minor spoiler end here . \\n\\n [ b]the rest of the game ? gunplay , craft , and more[/b ] \\n I start with the space exploration and RPG element because I believe they be the most controversial and seek - after piece of information . the rest of the game , though ? almost entirely improve over Fallout 4 . the gunplay be chef \\'s kiss ( for a Bethesda game ) . pilot a ship be reminiscent of no Man \\'s Sky . ship - building be extensive , but quite easy to start play around with . the craft be still simple and satisfying . much of craft be still lock behind skill , just like fallout 4 , but Starfield do not feel as difficult to reach as FO4 do . the handcraft map be arguably their most detailed and beautiful design yet . \\n\\n the balance have be very adequate for I personally . I could feel my character get strong , more skilled , but also enemy always provide a decent challenge . nothing be too easy or too difficult- I never have to change difficulty from normal mode . I have hear complaint that later on , enemy get very bullet - spongey , but I simply have never have that issue and I mainly use handgun . while there be an enormous variety of skill to pick from , leveling be fast enough where I never feel like I need to save my skill point ( as some skill have requisite to level ) . if I do not meet the requirement yet , I simply level a different skill and wait for next level to try and improve the other skill . \\n\\n [ b]It \\'s not perfect[/b ] \\n it do miss some thing their previous game do as well . but it be a Bethesda game through and through . beautiful environment , fantastic immersion and storytelling . fulfil the fantasy of live in another universe , especially in space . Starfield have become a game I would love to play again and again . Bethesda have restore my trust in they , even after the launch state of FO76 and the reduction of RPG element in FO4 . I look forward to future update , the DLC , and tes 6 . I hope you can play Starfield , come to your own conclusion , and hopefully enjoy the same thing I be able to as well .', 'in a sea of review from other , I be sure that only my Steam friend will see this . the more you play this game , the well it get . try not to be pay attention to hater that be eager to see the next big thing fail . this game be a passion project and it show . it be also a Bethesda game . give it time to come into its own . if you be look for a spacefaring Bethesda game , get it . if you want to wait , wait for a sale . but in my opinion , this game have be worth the price at launch . cheer !', 'this game make I worried about Elder Scrolls 6', 'the main story mission and the major faction mission be really good but unfortunately after finish they the entire universe just feel empty . there be still thing to do after that but they be just not interesting enough to keep you play .

I be about 40 hour in as I write this and I have 0 crash and minimum of bug . those bug be mostly funny than annoying , and none of they be game breaking . loading screen be a bit of a let down but I get use to they too . the thing I have to say be most annoying to I be the surface map .. I get that , you can not have detailed map on every planet , but at least the major Cities could have it . Most of the time I roam around the City for a long time before I find what I look for . I hope City map get add , if not by Bethesda then by some modder . overall , great game that will definetly get well in the future , with help of Community or Bethesda itself .', 'if you like Bethesda game , you will like this . if you do not like Bethesda game , you will not like this .

I miss it bethy , I miss it a lot .\", \"if you be look for an incredible story or some sort of Space Trucker sim this game be not it . it be a more advanced Fallout 4 in space where the kinda cool but not super well do idea from that game actually go somewhere . if you enjoy root through random place and carry too much junk and care more about the side quest than the main plot like basically every other Bethesda game then this be good , great even . it be the most Oblivion esque game quest density wise they have make , there be so much stuff to do in every city and even some of the minor settlement have more than I expect . the Space stuff be fun but it be ultimately part of the game and not the focus and the story like Fallout 3 be serviceable but nothing special . I would not really say the writing be a mixed bag as nothing have make I really roll my eye or cringe but there have be plenty that do not do a whole lot with the scenario / concept , it range from middle to fairly entertaining . for reference a game like the Outer Worlds make I cringe like crazy and I hate every single character . \\n\\n I have play roughly 30 hour now and honestly do not feel like I be even close to do with the game and there be multiple of the major faction I have not do a single quest for . the rpg element be definitely well than Skyrim / Fallout 4 ( my background as a big game hunter have surprisingly matter quite a few time ) and they finally refresh their lock pick mini game after 15 year . the combat be refine to be an actual passable shooter now , it be not Doom Eternal or anything but you can be pretty fluid . I will also praise the perk tree . almost everything in they be interesting and I have a hard time decide what I want to spec into , and they make the smart move of add challenge to get the next level so there be no more get 100 Gun Skill by lvl 4 like in Fallout 3 and do mega damage but it be not so bland and unrewarde as something like Skyrim . \\n\\n I have encounter some bug most of they be benign minor thing like weird physic , NPC 's acting strangely , I have my gun fail to swap once so my guy be hold air but it go away after swap to something else . the only genuinely frustrating one I have have be there be a softlock you can get if something interrupt your conversation . one time a giant crab murder the person I be talk to and I could not do anything and have to restart , the other time it be when talk to a vendor and a qu NPC interrupt . it do not happen every time but its a legitimate and frustrating bug . the performance on my system have be adequate but I will not pretend this game be not a bit of a hog . \\n\\n I will say the loading screen complaint I have see as a talking point be completely asinine . like beyond ridiculous . you get 1 - 3 second loading screen when go between planet and some interior . specifically between planet you might get two or three quickly back to back if you be be efficient in how you go about land and take off then jump to the next place but everyone bitch its break their immersion be just attach themselves to the current regurgitated whining . you would think they be play Morrowind on the original xbox or something with the multiple minute loading screen . \\n\\n I do not want to get too much into the meta commentary here but it feel like most of complaint I read about Starfield be that it be a Bethesda game that be structure and play like a Bethesda game and they do not like that or be expect something else . which be funny because that have basically be a huge amount of the criticism around all their release since Skyrim really .\", 'Starfield be a game that have an excess of nothingness . \\n an open world RPG that be so overstuff with meaningless content that the seam be start to split and the empty calorie be spill out . \\n\\n Starfield be big , both physically require 125 GB to install , but also in activity . \\n planet , city , mission , npc , combat , research , space travel , space combat , space research , ship building , base building , relationship building , main story , side story , faction , job , and cooking . \\n\\n and all of it beautiful , grand , silent , serine , action pack , and ultimately unfulfille . \\n a tremendous lack of focus make each individual part of the game hollow . \\n \\n in the modern Glittering Era of entertainment ; Starfield be another spec of shine , so concerned with bland mass appeal that it make any individual gameplay mechanic as empty as the space we ’re fly through . \\n', 'more loading screen than game play', 'in just 30 hour I have : \\n\\n - shot down several starship and collect their bounty \\n - board a ship on the ground and hijack it mid - air \\n - Blew all my money modifying say ship \\n - learn how to make drug \\n - Trafficked say drug \\n - Fought in a gang war \\n - got a white collar office job \\n - got a blue collar assembly line job \\n - use both job to commit crime \\n - commit corporate espionage \\n - help an electrician solve power outage \\n - stole the jackpot from an abandon zero - g space casino \\n - pick side in a marital argument \\n - sell water to a deserted starship at 300 % markup \\n - build a house \\n - gain superpower \\n - be too busy to notice the deteriorate nature of my real - world friendship and relationship , because who else be go to deliver 200 kg of copper to the Stroud Eklund Staryard ?', '77hrs in : \" finish \" starfield . \\n\\n now , it have a ng+ mode which be intriguing , so I be actually still play it ... but the story actively encourage you to finish it multiple time .. and restart over and over and over , which be ... curious . so I be onboard . \\n\\n I be still on the fence about the title as a whole . \\n\\n enjoy it ? yes , very much . \\n\\n but it be hard to compare to previous title ( such as Fallout4 ) because I end up play those in a heavily modde state , which skew my memory of the raw , unmodded game . \\n\\n Starfield be currently raw and unmodded . it be an RPG . it be a story . it be not about exploration , space flight , or space trucking . it be an adventure . it have a story and you be a participant . \\n\\n the Bethesda feel be here in spade , and that include a clunky interface with awful / useless filter and option ( gadamn Bethesda , will you grow up and modernize this already ?

Te - di - ous . \\n\\n I have always feel that Bethesda create great experience , and even well foundation for modder to go nuts with , and it be the modded experience that really make it for I . \\n\\n here Starfield absolutely and firmly fall into that camp . it be a great foundation for what be to come . \\n do not get I wrong , I have be enjoy the experience and I will continue to do so , but I be look forward to mod buff out the Bethesda quirk and menu annoyance , and hopefully some reason to build an outpost ( because right now there be not one ) . \\n\\n currently ...

I be at a loss to comprehend Bethesda \\'s direction . in an era grace by masterpiece like cyberpunk 2077 , Red Dead Redemption II , Elden Ring , and Baldur \\'s Gate , Bethesda have somehow manage to release a game that feel archaic , lackluster , and painfully underwhelming . the game \\'s script be lackadaisical , the gameplay lethargic , and the overall experience be profoundly uninspire . it be a far cry from the innovative standard set in 2023/24 . \\n\\n this weekend , as I pen this review , the player count speak volume : \\n\\n Starfield : 20,027 player \\n Fallout 4 : 20,089 player \\n Skyrim SE : 23,723 player \\n\\n these figure paint a grim picture for Bethesda . it take they eight year to produce a game that not only fail to surpass but barely match the engagement of their old title . a \" Fallout 4 - Space Edition \" or a substantial DLC would have likely be a more successful venture . \\n\\n I play Starfield for a mere 8 hour , enough to confirm the myriad issue highlight in other review . I refuse to waste more time on a game that have leave I , a long - time Bethesda admirer , deeply disappointed , frustrated , and sadden . there be no incentive for I to invest my creativity in play or modde Starfield . \\n\\n Bethesda , this be a farewell from a disheartened fan . peace .', \"Todd Howard that little elf f'd I again\"] ['I play for 75 hour because I need the dopamine fix . look back its a boring story , in a boring world . \\n\\n also I cannot get over the one mission I think would be awesome . find a ship launch from earth 200 year early with the offspring of the original crew finally find humanity ... and they have the same computer with the same operating system on their ship as the rest of the universe . why why WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYY \\n\\n * little update * \\n\\n yes I too find it funny that Bethesda AI bot think that after 75 hour I would not know about smuggling , outpost , starship customization ... yes I have do those absolutely dull and mostly pointless activity . just cause there be a thousand bore planet to visit , do not mean I want to visit they .', 'I will sum it up for you guy . \\n 1 . do you like oblivion or Skyrim ? yes ? - buy it . \\n 2 . do you like Fallout ? yes ? - buy it . \\n 3 . be you expect no Man \\'s Sky or Star Citizen ? double think on buy it . \\n\\n do not expect a super engage \" No Man \\'s Sky \" or Star Citizen killer , the space exploration aspect of the game be meh . but if you play it and treat it like just another Bethesda game , the game be an absolute banger and an upgrade from its predecessor .', '* Spoiler Free * \\n current playtime : 90 + hour . \\n // \\n starting info : \\n for anyone interested in playing , treat this game like a fallout in space . \\n it be not a space fly sim that allow free flying between planet and system . \\n Space travel consist of select a \" landing spot - planet - system \" with a short cut scene in between zone of play . \\n // \\n load time : \\n 3 - 5 second average ( * modern nvme * ) \\n // \\n graphic : \\n look great for its scale , modern pbr material with highly detailed model wherever you look * very dense * . \\n volumetric fog & atmosphere really make it look amazing . side note \" very time of day dependent \" as it do in real life . \\n // \\n Gameplay : \\n first - third person . \\n all bethesda style thing one might expect : quest , encounter , gun - melee , speech , sneaking , lockpicke etc ( * classic * ) \\n spaceship : ship combat , Docking , ship - to - ship hailing / trading , smuggling , fully walkable / customizable ship & interior . \\n outpost : buildable outpost , basis , storage , resource extraction , factory \\'s , multi system outpost connection , decoration . \\n customization : Ships , Spacesuits , Helmets , Boostpacks , Weapons , outpost . almost everything . \\n // \\n Hardware & Performance : \\n this be a heavy game ! 5600x & 3080 use 75 % fsr upscale at 4 K give I an average of 40 - 60 fps depend . \\n Amd graphic card seem to have well optimization currently compare to nvidia . also no nvidia driver at time of writing . \\n Plenty of graphic option to tweak if you need well performance , most option from medium - up look great without a significant loss of quality . \\n // \\n Tutorials : \\n very lacking . many system be introduce and barely give any information on how they operate . \\n would benefit from tooltips & side panel give more explanation and direction . \\n as some system and unlock be hide behind skill ! \\n example : \\n ever wonder why you can not use a ship part ? or do not see building for farming and animal in your outpost ? \\n or what about scan a planet for more advanced resource ? check your skill tree ! \\n // \\n Scale : \\n its actually immense ! 90 + hour in and I only finish one side - faction questline ! ! there be just so much to do ! ! it be actually amazing the amount of voice character that be in this , just find some random character in the middle of nowhere might lead to a multiple hour quest . random encounter vary from basic to interesting . \\n 10 % of planet be the highlight with a city or some main location on they or have a staryard up above the planet . \\n the main city be massive , multiple time I think I have see it all only to find there be an elevator lead to a whole different part of it with its own area \\'s and quest . and if you be not as interested in base building or resource gathering then you can easily see what planet have useful location on they so you can skip most of the generate / place location if that be your preference . \\n 90 % of planet largely have resource & randomly place location and encounter on they . \\n but even then , some encounter can give you some pretty awesome moment & simply check a planet for resource you need to quickly place an outpost with some extractor on they so it can be auto - transport to your main base be useful . \\n // \\n Music & Audio : \\n great !

Melee exist , and that be about all that can be say about it . Stealth exist for the first shot fire , and exclude a specific questline , have no other purpose ; it be simply a modifier to the above gunplay . \\n [ * ] enemy scale to your level , there be no sense of progression . any likewise level weapon only exist to keep pace with the increase health of bullet - sponge enemy . never will you feel like you be more powerful , or that you be fight a different fight than the last . \\n [ * ] there be four kind of enemy , human , robot , fauna , and turret . human be either pirate , spacer , or fanatic . robot behave like human , and all variant behave exactly the same way , require no change in methodology than run / shoot . Fauna behave like animal , and outside of one questline , never actually have to be engage . \\n [ * ] Combine both point above and you have one kind of fight , all of the time . there be no variation in combat whatsoever . \\n [ * ] space combat be passable , but all ship behave the same way . you can build something tanky or something maneuverable , but it make little difference in the fight themselves . ship building be mostly an aesthetic exercise . \\n [ * ] there be no point in the crafting or outpost building mechanic . they give you no real advantage , its nothing but menu hopping , and be completely unnecessary for either survival or integrate quest . be it not for the activity prompt tell you that it exist , you would never notice it or think you have miss something ( you have not ) . \\n [ * ] regard main story ability , the process for acquire they be likewise extremely tedious , repetitive , and unrewarding . \\n [ /list ] \\n\\n [ b]exploration[/b ] \\n [ list ] \\n [ * ] the galaxy be extremely empty . each planet , include the major \" settle \" planet , be simply procedurally generate empty space . you have to \" fly \" to they , which just consist of open the map , cycle though the star - system - planet menu , and fast travel to they . there be no way to travel to they manually , and nothing to see along the way . \\n [ * ] you will occasionally have a random encounter in the orbit of the planet as you arrive to it . this be often just ship combat with pirate , but you will occasionally meet a friendly ship with two or three line of dialog . that be it . \\n [ * ] there be four major city , and an equal number of minor settlement . these be very small , and likewise devoid of life or point of interest . one city be a giant airport terminal . one city be a western themed potemkin village . one city be a hole in the ground . the only interesting city be Neon , the cyberpunk oil platform . the minor settlement be a few empty building that only exist as destination for one or two fetch quest . \\n [ * ] the outpost dungeon be repetitive , literally copy and paste location that have the exact same loot , enemy , and write note . if you have visit one type , you see all there be of it . there be maybe seven different type . \\n [ * ] the loot be level and even \" unique \" weapon be visually and functionally identical to their base model . there be no point in collect they , or display they other than their name . \\n [ * ] all this work out to make exploration an entirely unrewarding experience of sitting though take off / grav jump / landing cutscene and menu hop in between , with nothing to show or do at the end of the time waste do this . \\n [ /list ] \\n\\n [ b]quest , Characters , and writing[/b ] \\n [ list ] \\n [ * ] there be a few good questline , with an emphasis on few . some be interesting , but be mostly pad out by intervene fetch quest . while those few be fun at part , their big effect be highlight how boring and meaningless other \" major \" questline be . thoughtful storytelling and interesting plot be possible , but reserve for only a handful of questline . the main quest be not one of they . \\n [ * ] side quest that be not fetch quest or at least be well disguised fetch quest can also be interesting , but often be not . you can stumble on a few of these through exploration . \\n [ * ] the number of quest be woefully small . it can not be more than twenty , if you do not count each and every objective as individual quest . this compound the feeling of emptiness . in freeform exploration , there be nothing to do . in major hub , there be very little to do . \\n [ * ] there be no faction lockout , no allegiance or faction system . you can do everything in one playthrough . there be nothing that would make you want to replay the game once you have do all there be to do ; no try a new build , no explore a new faction . this be especially ironic at the end of the game . \\n [ * ] the character all share basically the same worldview , and there be no tension between they or the player character . there be always an objective \" right \" choice , and an objective \" wrong \" choice , and no benefit to choose the wrong choice . \\n [ * ] the writing for the character be basically one dimensional . few character will be remember after you have interact with they . once you have resolve their problem of having leave their coffee mug in another star system , they stop exist as anything other than a faceless npc . once or twice you will be recognize as someone who do anything , for a single line of dialogue . \\n [ * ] each story be entirely self contain . there be no wide impact on the galaxy writ small , and when a questline be over , you will be unable to tell if you ever complete it at all . there be no sense of life , response , or consequence to your action . \\n [ * ] procedurally generate quest be go here , grab that , go there , shoot that , or haul resource for I . these usually take you to one of the give set of outpost location , which , when combine with the painful lack of variety of location , mean you will be go to the same place over and over again . \\n [ * ] without spoiler , the completion of the main quest will make each and every above point painfully exaggerated . \\n [ /list ] \\n\\n [ b]conclusion[/b ] \\n Starfield be a major step back not just from the general gaming industry , the rpg genre , but Bethesda themselves . it be entirely unclear what be be do during the exaggerated development time and with all the money spend on it . there be less to do than in Fallout 4 . there be less to do than in one hold of Skyrim . there be less to do than in independently develop early access game . when compare to other game that have release not just around the same time , but year prior , and from Bethesda themselves , it be insultingly disappointing . any modder look to \" fix \" the game would well spend their time develop a new one from scratch , there simply be not enough to build off of to make it worthwhile . \\n\\n [ b]as a lifelong Bethesda fanboy , it have break my heart to write this , but I do it so you may be spare . play anything else.[/b ]', 'I love BGS game .

Boring . \\n\\n everything from location to quest , character , companion and villain feel terribly generic , underwhelming and soulless . not once in my nearly 70 hour have I say , in my head , \\' now this be interesting \\' - or cool , or deep , or mysterious enough to interest I . that ’s not go to happen , because try to please everyone with cookie cutter narrative and character design end up please no one . \\n\\n the world look cool , and be visually fantastic in its detail , especially out in the wild . interior , ship and general indoor location , save for a few , feel generic and same - y , and do not have the same level of interactivity see in previous Bethesda game . they even remove the gore system everyone love . the attempt at a \\' late - hard - sci - fi \\' universe fail miserably , because it ’ not nearly gritty enough , and do not take itself seriously enough , to be fitting for a true \\' hard sci fi \\' . \\n\\n [ h3]exploration & secrets[/h3 ] \\n you ’ll explore the galaxy use your ship , jump from system to system , able to land on pretty much any planet that have solid ground . once disembark , you ’ll proceed on foot and , if you have the right perk , move fast with the aid of a jump pack for additional jump reach and well mobility . reach most location be a tiresome affair , since your running speed will be very slow compare to the distance you ’ll have to cross - with very little of interest between you and the next map marker . \\n\\n forget all the interesting random encounter of Fallout or Elder Scrolls , those will not happen on these barren planet . point of interest range from small outpost to multi - layered facility , often fill with enemy , container , loot , locked door , terminal with lore - the usual . they ’re interesting to explore the first time around , however the massive amount of copy - pasting will make they tiresome soon , since very few truly unique one exist outside of questline . \\n\\n exploration be compound with a surveying system allow you to painstakingly scan all resource , animal , element and flora of each planet and then sell the datum for a pittance - that ’ not worth do and take age . there be some secret in the form of hide location discoverable only by read specific document , or hidden container inside poi , but they ’re usually underwhelming - exception apply . \\n\\n [ h3]combat system & bosses[/h3 ] \\n you ’ll be able to use a variety of weapon that either deal physical , energy or EM ( stun ) damage , and also modify they via workbench - same go for armor part . there be rarity tier that add passive property , although most of they be gimmick not worth grind Legendary Enemies for . the problem with weapon in Starfield be that they feel too similar to one another , and even \\' unique \\' name one be just normal gun with pre - set modification and affix , none of they be TRULY something one of a kind you can not find anywhere else , powerful and sublime to look for . \\n\\n combat gunplay be fine , somewhat on the same level of Fallout 4 , but less dynamic , with bad AI , and less gore / impact feel from shot . all enemy you ’ll face feel the same , behave the same and look the same because 90 % of the time everyone wear spacesuit , even while inside . except in city . companion be brainless meat - shield only useful to carry additional cargo , and the enemy AI be so dumb you ’ll have a cake walk if you use a stealth build or just use basic cover . you ’ll eventually acquire special power due to your \" choose \" status , which be meme I never really find useful . I ’ve fight a total one unique boss in 70 hour in a specific quest , the rest be just oversized / rename / reskinne generic enemy over and over again . FillerField . \\n\\n [ h3]companion & quests[/h3 ] \\n companion be one sided - flat and cringe in most case . they do not really seem to react to your personal disposition in meaningful way , or to your action , and when they actually do , you can always persuade they to stick with you for the sake of the plot - God forbid actual freedom of choice . remember how in say , New Vegas , companion ditch you if you behave against their value or belief , or ally with a faction they hate ? that ’s not go to happen here , and there be not even a Faction reputation system to begin with .', 'eld scroll 6 be go to suck be not it ?', 'I be not go to write this at first because I be so 50/50 on recommend it or not but after Bethesda start reply to negative review about why the review they have write be wrong I feel compel to write something . \\n\\n I would not recommend this game for $ 70 . I would recommend wait until the game be fully release with all of its DLCs * on * * sale * to buy it . to I there be just not enough there to justify the price . it feel like a game that be only have a few year of development rather than seven and it be just kind of under cooked . \\n\\n the game itself be just boring and uninspired . it be sterile and safe , build to appeal to the wide possible audience and not offend anybody . the character sometimes have their shine moment but for the most part be bland and your companion be the bad of these offender because they all have the same opinion on everything , they be all the same . the character also do not look great , they have this dead eyed uncanny valley effect to they make bad by the skyrim style zoom in whenever they talk . \\n\\n the quest themselves with the exception of a few , be so uninspired and boring and offer no moral dilemma or require any serious thought . compare the Ryujin quest line to the thief guild quest line in Oblivion . with the thief guild quest like there be a gradual progression which teach the player not only how to be a thief but what to expect as far as how challenge a give assignment will be . Ryujin give you three childishly easy quest that be so easy that they neither teach you how to be a thief nor give you an idea of what be to come then the difficulty meter suddenly jump with the next quest to really quite difficult . thankfully I happen to have enough level save up to dump some point into stealth otherwise I would have have to fail or just leave the quest , level up , and come back . this quest comparison also highlight another issue because Ryujin take place in one of the sad area in the game , Neon . \\n\\n location . what be Bethesdas engine really good at ? it make it relatively easy to hand craft huge world . so what do Starfield do ? they hand craft a few location and leave the rest up to procedural generation of course ! ... oh , well ... the few hand craft location be great right ? no ? oh okay then . New Atlantis be kinda cool but it be so small , it be close to have some literal and figurative depth to it with the well but that be barely explored . New Akila look cool but again be far too small . the Key be not a city . and Neon ... oh Jesus Christ Neon ... \\n\\n Neon be \" we have nightcity from CP2077 at home . \" it be suppose to be this cyberpunk , blade runner - esque city rampant with crime and drug use . you basically get the DisneyLand ( not even DisneyWorld ) version of that . there be no crime to witness . there be no daily schedule like Oblivion npc have . just the same blank face stare at you like your cock be out but you do not know it like all the other city . they hype up a drug that can only be buy in a particular very talk up club in Neon and the club be one of the sad thing I have ever see in a game . it be one relatively tiny room with flash neon light and out of shape spandex wear conehead cosplayer gyrate uncomfortably . keep in mind this be one of the few hand craft location , pretty much everything else be procedurally generate . you also can not even smuggle the drug out for any profit , it be worth the same no matter what planet you bring it to which do not make any sense . so location be not great which bring I to exploration ... \\n\\n Exploration in Starfield be not great . in a fallout or an eld Scrolls game you can stumble upon countless interesting hand craft location and encounter in the game to the point that getting lose be a good thing . in Starfield you will not stumble upon anything because you fast travel from planet to planet , system to system . so to explore that have to be your express goal . okay , fine . except everything be procedurally generate so after you have do it once you be just go to see it copy and paste on different look planet . you be not go to find anything new in that cave because it be the same cave . you be not go to find anything interesting on that planet because it be go to have the same stuff as the last one , just with different plant around it and the ground a different color . just go system to system look for content until you get bore with that . they make some decent random encounter that you can have while out in space but not enough of they , I have run into Grandma half a dozen time by now . \\n\\n and as far as thing to do ... the ending : spoiler ahead obviously . it be another multiverse story . I understand 7 year ago when the game begin development this concept be not quite as tired and cliche as it have become but good God be I sick of multiverse . the whole point of the game be to just replay it again , that be how it end . I wish I be joke . it be message be basically it be not about the destination , it be about the journey , which be fine but the journey be not good ... unfortunately the game have , to I , no replayability until new content in the form of DLC drop . which I may not even buy until it go on sale because I just do not care . the story be that uninteresting . \\n\\n this be not to say that everything about Starfield be bad . the gun play be actually pretty great though not worth it alone to buy the game . the ship building be actually really fun despite it be janky , probably some of the most fun I have have in the game . some of the quest be fun like the UC quest line and other short , one off quest . they all have the same problem though : if they do offer any interesting idea they do not fully explore they , they acknowledge they and that be about it . thing like the Well , tension between the UC and Rangers , and the UC be a fascist state be all explore in only the most superficial term . Bethesda have always have the problem of be wide as a lake but deep as a puddle and Starfield be unfortunately a prime example of how this problem have only get bad with every subsequent Bethesda release since Morrowind . \\n\\n I do enjoy part of this game but I can not recommend it for $ 70 . it be so frustrating to see Bethesda finally get a crack at create a unique ip that be not another eld Scrolls or fallout game and they make this boring , uninspired whimper of a game . this game be all of Bethesdas bad habit , everything they be bad at and nothing they be good at , finely distil . \\n\\n one of the most frustrating thing to I be that this game be mediocre , it be not bad like no Mans Sky and it do not ruin Bethesdas reputation like CP2077 do on release so it be not go to get the attention it need to be make into great game like those studio do . chance be post launch will be handle very much like FO4 where we will get a couple of bug fix but not nearly enough and a couple of nickle and dime DLCS then one or two really solid one . they have es6 to get to work on after all . this mean the game will probably not have a miracle come back like those game do and will probably always be mediocre , which I think be a shame because it do have good bone there be just no meat on they .', 'a game about space in which your ship be nothing more than set - dressing for storage container and an optional , extremely simplistic , arcade style mini - game where fly your ship in a line while hold the trigger long enough for every AI to blow themselves up by fly directly into your path . \\n\\n a game about exploration that deliver the thrill of open your menu , select the fast travel option , click to fast travel to a star system , loading , then open your menu , click to fast travel to a planet , loading , then answer the same NPC dialogue at every planet before you be treat to another loading screen to finally land on planet . \\n\\n an immersive rpg in which every door in every colony be a loading screen and fire an infinite stream of bullet around citizen head in the middle of the city be apparently just another Tuesday in America for the New Atlantians as they , completely unbothered by the frag grenade go off all around they , continue to partake in every colonist favorite activity -- walk aimlessly into wall . \\n\\n a game which offer swashbuckling adventure in which successfully steal a ship be as easy as kill 5 brainless npc . the payoff be possibly the most accurate Gamestop trade - in simulator ever make . it cost 20k to \" register \" the ship , the ship only sell for 22k and once you have collect your pittance , you will see the exact same ship on the market with an asking price of 500k from the guy that give you 2k for it . \\n\\n a game burst with content in which each outpost and mission be functionally the same as the first 10 you play and you will be ask to do they all 100 + time with almost zero variation . honestly , after the first 20 hour , Starfield practically beg you to save yourself 120GBs of storage space and forget it exist . \\n\\n a grip story - line in which every character be as exciting as the bread isle in the grocery store and none of your choice matter . seriously , exactly which brand of white bread you take home with you from the grocery store have more serious consequence than literally any decision Starfield ask the player to make . \" White or Wheat ? \" be a more thrilling dilemma than anything in Starfield \\'s narrative . \\n\\n a ground - break new IP that try its hard to be exactly like its sister ip while utterly fail to deliver a fraction of their charm or greatness . this be easily the most disappointing Bethesda title ever make , include \" Elder Scrolls Blades , \" because at least no one care about , want , or have any expectation for a mobile title . it genuinely feel like , at some point in development , the list of \" Good Ideas for Starfield , \" and \" Bad Ideas for Starfield , \" get swap and they make the bad possible version of Starfield that could be make . \\n\\n the absolute good that can be say of this title be that it really be one of the game of all time .', '\" for every star , there be a field . \" \\n -John Starfield']\n"
